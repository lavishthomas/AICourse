Ã— Super Power User

You're looking at a pure marketing machine here, known as a Super Power User.

If a community member is rocking this shiny icon, they've been active on inbound.org for eight weeks straight! That means they've been in the trenches, starting discussions, adding thoughtful insights, and helping the community know what's good with their upvotes.

Words can't describe how much we love our Super Power Users!
