Since the dawn of civilization, humanity has been growing food to stave off hunger. While most of us go to a store for this now, growing your own food can be as rewarding as it is delicious. If you’re not sure where to start, this chart will give you all the essential info.

This graphic, courtesy of Fix.com, is a cornucopia of tips on how to get your own vegetable garden started. It details which vegetables are suited for container gardens (you probably won’t want to grow a pumpkin in a pot by the windowsill), which soil to choose, how to choose the right sized bed, plant spacing, and more.

The guide even has a handy section on which vegetables pair well together, so you can get the most out of the space in your garden. There are also tips on how to build your garden to keep pests out. If you want to plant some vegetables but have no idea where to start, this one graphic should be able to get you started in a hurry.
