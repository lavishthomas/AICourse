It's nice to decorate your bathroom vanity with fancy beauty products. But if we're keeping it real, there's nothing like a good ole drugstore item. Even as a beauty editor who has tried some of everything on the market, I've got a couple of low-cost faves that I'll never replace. And makeup artists , models , and actresses agree: You don't always have to spend a ton of money to get your hands on a really great product.

The shrewdest bargain beauty shopper knows that not only are drugstore finds a great bang for your buck, but many of them can be used for multiple purposes, which increases the value even more. Out of dry shampoo? Sprinkle some baby powder on those roots and you’re good to go. Cash-saving genius. Not that you ever have to go long without your favorite drugstore product. If you're ever in a pinch, there's practically a CVS or Walgreens on every corner.

We asked 23 cosmetic companies to reveal their number-one all-time best sellers. These time-tested skin, hair, and makeup mainstays have you covered literally from head to toe—grab any (or all!) of them during your next corner-store run.
