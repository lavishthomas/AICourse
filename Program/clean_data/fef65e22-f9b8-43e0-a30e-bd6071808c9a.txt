If you’re trying to get your finances straight and you’re completely intimidated with the work ahead, take it one step at a time. Commit to just fifteen minutes of financial literacy a day.

It doesn’t seem like much, but making a daily habit of learning about money gets you more comfortable with the topic. Not only do you learn a little bit about personal finance over time, but the habit also keeps your money goals front of mind. Personal finance site Freedom Is Groovy explains:

Read at least one personal finance blog post or one page from a personal finance book. Personal finance isn’t rocket science. But there’s a lot to learn. And the best way to master personal finance is to study it every day. So every day, do one of two things. Read one personal finance blog, or read a few pages from a personal finance book. That’s it. Give yourself 15 minutes. If you can do more, great.

This is exactly what I did when paying off my student loan. My morning ritual always included having coffee and reading my favorite money blogs (back then it was Get Rich Slowly and MSN Money). I’d read about paying off debt, negotiating, being frugal, and so on. It took me about 10 or 15 minutes every morning, and over time, the advice really stuck.

Aside from books and blogs, there are plenty of free courses that can help, too. You could commit to spending 15 minutes on those courses every day. The idea is simply to make learning about money a daily habit. Over time, personal finance becomes much less intimidating.
