5 Prefab Companies Impacting Green Housing

Prefabrication isn't new. In fact, most everything around you is prefab: that picture frame on your desk, your computer monitor, even the light bulb above your head. Prefab simply means an item or components of an item are pre-assembled in a factory before the final product reaches you.

Even prefab homes have been around for decades. The mobile home revolutionized functional, affordable housing. For its time, modular housing was incredibly waste-efficient, too, compared to the on-site building processes of today, which can exhaust more than 30% of building materials.

Rather than overload our landfills, however, contemporary architectural firms and design companies are rethinking what prefab means for today's waste-conscious and energy-savvy homebuyers. Many are combining traditional modular concepts with a customized approach, allowing clients to select a basic design and alter it according to their tastes.

As you can imagine, carefully planned and pre-assembled homes render waste management an exact science. Many prefab homes reduce waste to 10% or less, which conserves the environment and saves money for the buyers. (Many homes can be built in the $200,000 range.)

Because these homes are factory-made, measurements are precise. Large pieces fit together like an erector set, whereupon the house is sealed tightly to conserve energy and potentially save a homeowner thousands of dollars every year. Companies also cut costs by offering features like recycled countertops and Marmoleum flooring.

Although the above five companies all specialize in prefab housing, each maintains a distinct design aesthetic and environmental standard. They represent a growing and influential consumer base that prioritizes sustainable and cost-efficient home solutions at lightning speed, and they could be in your city already.
