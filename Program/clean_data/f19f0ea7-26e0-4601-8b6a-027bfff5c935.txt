BuildZoom’s data platform gathers data from a variety of sources, including thousands of regulatory entities, general contractors, their clients, and more. As the volume of interactions on the BuildZoom platform increases, the system becomes more intelligent and better able to guide consumers towards the right decision. By making this research publicly available, we are able to dramatically increase the number of people that visit BuildZoom to research construction and remodeling. We currently receive about 60,000 US visitors/day, and we hope to grow this exponentially by gathering and exposing extra data. To accelerate the system’s rate of learning, we’re looking for an entrepreneur to systematize and scale existing processes and invent new ones that are aimed at gathering intelligence from the marketplace.
