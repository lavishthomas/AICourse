DMV's Goal

One of the Department of Motor Vehicles' (DMV) major goals is to keep all drivers licensed for as long as it is safe to do so. Along with that goal is the responsibility to enhance highway safety by increasing driver competency. DMV also recognizes that the independence and mobility that driving provides are important factors in the quality of life for most Californians.

What to expect

You can expect to be treated with respect, fairness, and courtesy during the entire examination process. If you are not treated in this manner, please contact the office manager.

DMV Wants You to Pass

Many people take their driving test when they have not sufficiently prepared, or have not practiced enough, or have not practiced the right way. Others get very nervous because they don't know what to expect. Remember, the DMV examiner will ride with you only to make sure that you can drive safely and obey traffic laws.

Your driving test will last about 20 minutes. The test consists of basic maneuvers you will encounter while driving such as: left and right turns, stops at controlled and uncontrolled intersections, straight line backing, lane changes, driving in regular street traffic, and in some cases driving on the freeway.

DMV wants you to pass your driving test. Study this pamphlet as well as the California Driver Handbook ( PDF ). Relax and do your best.

Who Takes a Driving Test?

You will be required to take a driving test if you have:

never been licensed in any state or you hold a foreign country license.

you hold a foreign country license. a vision-related problem.

a limited term license for specified physical and mental (P&M) conditions.

a physical condition (except corrective lenses) and DMV imposes a restriction, or if you are currently restricted and you request that the restriction be removed.

if you are currently restricted and you request that the restriction be removed. an out-of-state junior, provisional, or probationary license.

been licensed out-of-state but do not have the license to surrender.

Driving tests for license renewals or holders of out-of-state or U.S. territory licenses are normally waived, if the license is presented. However, DMV may require a driving test at any time.

Are All Driving Tests the Same?

The driving test for the basic license class (Class C) is the same for all drivers regardless of age. An adult driver takes the same type of driving test as a teenage driver. A driver with a physical and/or mental condition may take a different version of the driving test containing additional test elements.

Get enough practice. Some drivers need more practice than others. Minors must complete 50 hours of behind-the-wheel training (including ten hours of required night driving) before taking a driving test. When you practice, pretend you are taking a driving test. Ask your accompanying driver to calmly point out your mistakes. Ask questions about a particular driving situation that may have confused you. Correct your mistakes. The next time you practice, pay particular attention to correct any driving errors you made the time before.

Practice all the driving maneuvers listed in the Safe Driver checklist below. The DMV examiner is there to ensure you have demonstrated you can handle your vehicle in regular traffic situations, not to trick you. During your driving test, the examiner will note how you obey the rules of the road and traffic signs and/or signals. He/she will note other areas in which you may need improvement.

Safe driving tips. Practice these tips to improve your driving skills: Steer smoothly at all times. Accelerate smoothly. Don't race the engine or make it stall. Stop the vehicle gently. Start braking well ahead of where you must stop to avoid sudden "jerks." Know where to stop. Be aware of crosswalks. If your view is blocked at a crosswalk, move forward carefully and look both ways before entering the intersection.. Be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. Don't grind the gears. Don't coast to a stop. Always obey the posted speed limits. If needed, reduce your speed to adjust for existing weather, road, and other traffic conditions. Remember to turn on your lights if you need to use your windshield wipers in poor weather conditions. Follow at a safe distance. Use the three-second rule. Increase your following distance in bad weather or poor visibility. Know what the traffic signals mean and obey them at all times. Always use the proper lane. Turn from the correct lane into the correct lane. Signal for all lane changes and turns. Always look for potential hazards (scan). Check your mirrors frequently. Always look over the proper shoulder before making lane changes or pulling away from the curb. Drive defensively. Anticipate another driver's errors.



If you are unsure about your driving skills, review the following DMV publications: Parent-Teen Training Guide ( PDF ), Senior Guide for Safe Driving, California Driver Handbook ( PDF ), and the Let's Go for a Drive streaming videos available online at: www.dmv.ca.gov.

After Your Driving Test

Learning to drive safely does not end with your driving test. Your license means you have met the driving test requirements.
