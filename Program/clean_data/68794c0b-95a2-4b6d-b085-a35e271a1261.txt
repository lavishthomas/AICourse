Now the ‘Robin Hood of the internet’ has just expanded the chat bot to Facebook Messenger to help refugees in the US, Canada and the UK claim asylum.

“Ultimately, I just want to level the playing field so there’s a bot for everything,” he told Business Insider.

“I originally started with parking tickets and delayed flights and all sorts of trivial consumer rights issues,” he added. “But then I began to be approached by these non-profits and lawyers who said the idea of automating legal services is bigger than just a few parking fines. So I’ve since tried to expand into doing something more humanitarian.”

The bot asks users a series of questions in real time, such as “Have you, your family or colleagues ever experienced harm or threats?”
