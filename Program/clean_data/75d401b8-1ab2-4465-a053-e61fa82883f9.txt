They noticed that people with a variation in the ApoE4 gene, linked to Alzheimer’s, tended to die well before those without it.

Another significant trend captured by the study was a drop, starting in middle age, in the frequency of a mutation in the CHRNA3 gene associated with heavy smoking in men, indicating a higher death rate in that group.

The study described as “surprising” that just two common gene mutations could play such a large role in influencing survival, and that the fact there were not more mutations indicated they had been naturally “selected out”.

“Men can father children even at old age, and even if a tiny fraction of them do so, over time this may be enough of an effect for selection to “see” and act on,” said Hakhamenesh Mostafavi, who led the research.

“For example, if men with ApoE4 have 0.1% fewer children on average than men without them, this would be enough for these variants to be removed quickly by natural selection.”

Published in the journal PLOS Biology, the study also found that people genetically predisposed to delayed puberty and child-bearing lived longer.

A one-year puberty delay lowered the death rate by three to four percent in both men and women, while a one-year childbearing delay lowered the death rate by six percent in women.

The research team said the results are evidence that genetic variants that influence fertility are evolving in some U.S. and Britain populations.

But they cautioned that environment also plays a role, meaning that traits that are desirable now may not be in other populations or in the future.

"The environment is constantly changing," said the study's lead author, said Mr Mostafavi.

"A trait associated with a longer lifespan in one population today may no longer be helpful several generations from now or even in other modern day populations."
