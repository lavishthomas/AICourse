Technology has progressed at breakneck speeds over the past twenty years. Our lives today are dominated by the internet and smartphones, but in comparison with the radio and printing press, both of these technologies are modern inventions. And the pace of innovation isn't going to slow down anytime soon. Promising new fields like AR and AI are emerging at a rapid pace, and in five years we'll probably be wondering how we ever survived without being able to project our emails onto our sunglasses, much like we currently wonder at life before smartphones.

Despite all the advances we've made, a recent survey from Bank of America found that many people are still opting to use outdated technology. As we can see in this chart from Statista, people are hard pressed to give up the gadgets of the past.
