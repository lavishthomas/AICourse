And 31 percent of adults who either never attended college or never graduated say none of their closest friends had at least a four-year college degree.

The survey shows that the less educated aren’t quite as insular as the educated. Among those without a college degree, 10 percent said all of their five closest friends didn’t attend college. Among those with a college degree, 3 percent said all five of their closest friends never attended college.

Among Americans who say they had postgraduate educations — doctors, lawyers, professors, business-school graduates — 57 percent say four or five of their best friends have at least a college degree. Half of the people with a four-year college degree say that.

Divided by Party The divide was also sharply drawn when asked: How many of your five closest friends are Republicans? None All five friends Democratic Men Democratic Women Independent Men Independent Women Republican Men Republican Women 34% 43% 22% 35% 5% 7% 5% 3% 7% 7% 30% 25% None All five friends Democratic Men Democratic Women Independent Men Independent Women Republican Men Republican Women 34% 43% 22% 35% 5% 7% 5% 3% 7% 7% 30% 25%

Liberals are about as exclusive in their friendships as conservatives: 34 percent of them say four or five of their five closest friends have college degrees. Among conservatives it is 30 percent.

Others have tried to measure the elites’ bubble. PBS NewsHour created a quiz for its viewers based on “Coming Apart,” the 2012 book by Charles Murray, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The quiz sought to determine just how isolated the American elite are. It asked questions like “Have you ever bought an Avon product?” and “Have you ever bought a pickup truck?”

What it found was that on a scale of 1 to 100, the average score was 40, with a lower score indicating insulation from mainstream American culture. The quiz was a lot of fun, but it still left unanswered the question of how isolated and polarized Americans are.

Despite the separation of the college educated from the less educated, the Morning Consult survey shows that race still reveals a sharper separation. Among whites, 48 percent say all of their five closest friends are white. Thirty-six percent of blacks say all of their five closest friends are black, and 31 percent say none of their five closest friends are white.

As for the Other Party Similar results were produced when the question was: How many of your five closest friends are Democrats? None All five friends Democratic Men Democratic Women Independent Men Independent Women Republican Men Republican Women 7% 7% 23% 26% 32% 29% 31% 35% 8% 12% 6% 3% None All five friends Democratic Men Democratic Women Independent Men Independent Women Republican Men Republican Women 7% 7% 23% 26% 32% 29% 31% 35% 8% 12% 6% 3%

Not surprisingly, people of the same income level say they flock together. About one in three adults in households earning less than $50,000 a year say all of their friends have incomes that level or below. Almost four of 10 adults in households earning more than $100,000 a year say none of their five closest friends earn less than $50,000.

A bubble envelops people by party affiliation as well. Among Democrats, almost 34 percent say all of their closest friends are Democrats, while only 7 percent of Democrats that say that none of their closest friends are Democrats. With Republicans, 28 percent say all of their friends are Republican.

It should come as no surprise that Americans who tend to spend time with one another share the same views. Almost six in 10 people who disapprove of Barack Obama’s job performance as president say all five of their closest friends disapprove as well. Asked about the Affordable Care Act, 43 percent of those who oppose it say all five of their closest friends also oppose it. And 39 percent who support the health law say none of their five closest friends oppose it.

We see a sharper divide with abortion: 56 percent who oppose more restrictions on abortion say their friends feel the same way, and 39 percent who support more restrictions on abortion say all five of their closest friends support such restrictions.

People who identified as political moderates tend to have views that are closer to those of self-identified liberals than to those of self-identified conservatives. But in terms of sharing friendships among people with less education, political ideology seems to make little difference. Nearly the same percentage of moderates, conservatives and liberals — about 36 percent — have few or no friends without college degrees.
