It's a shame I never paid attention in physics class because outside of Walter White's school of chemistry, physics might be the coolest type of science around. It's okay though. BBC Science Club has got me covered with a fantastic short animation video detailing the history of physics. You know most of it—Galileo, Newton, Einstein—but get to know the other parts of the story of physics you should've learned a long time ago.

The animation was directed by Asa Lucander. I wish every high school class could have been replaced with wonderful animations like this. [Asa Lucander via Laughing Squid]
