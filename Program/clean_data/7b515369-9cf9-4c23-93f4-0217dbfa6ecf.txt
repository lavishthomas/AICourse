A teenage apprentice mechanic at Audi killed himself after bully colleagues burned his clothes and locked him in a cage, an inquest has heard.

George Cheese, 18, was "over the moon" when he got the position at the car dealership, his parents said, but soon started coming home covered in bruises and had multiple holes burned into his clothes.

A coroner heard that on one occasion, the young man said his colleagues had locked him in a cage at the garage by force, doused him in a flammable liquid and set fire to his clothes.

His father, Keith Cheese, told the inquest that he would never forgive himself for missing the warning signs leading to his son's death. He said that his son had approached him and tried to start a conversation the day he killed himself but he had not looked up, captivated by a pre-recorded golf tournament on the TV.

George committed suicide on 9 April 2016, around six months after he started working for Audi.
