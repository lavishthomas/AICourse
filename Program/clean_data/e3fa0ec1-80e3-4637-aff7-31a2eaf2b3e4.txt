Silent train and bus journeys can be long and miserable, but one study found that a bit of small talk with strangers can make those trips more enjoyable.

Researchers at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business divided commuters into three groups—one told to ignore their fellow travellers, another told to speak with another passenger, the third given no direction. Those asked to interact with other commuters had the most pleasant journeys, while those remaining silent had the least enjoyable commute.

Inspired by this, writer John Corcoran conducted a 21 day "happiness experiment". As part of it he decided "chat up strangers at every opportunity" and found the experience rewarding, too:

"Overall, I felt great about most of my interactions with strangers. Almost every interaction left me feeling a little happier. I also felt like I learned new things by talking to people from different walks of life who I wouldn't normally meet. I didn't have a single experience where I felt awkward, or where I felt like I bothered someone by engaging in conversation."

Of course, that doesn't mean you need to talk people's ear off when they're uninterested—don't go out of your way to bother people—but a little casual chitchat can brighten everyone's day. Hit the link for tips on mastering the art of small talk.
