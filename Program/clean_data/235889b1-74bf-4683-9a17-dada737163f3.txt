The Student ID. Oh, so much more than a horribly scanned picture of yourself that gives you access to your dorm.

Our culture takes pity on poor college students, so you should always carry yours with you.

You never know what kinds of goodies, freebies and discounts are available to you. You should always ask in stores, at sports venues and at restaurants if they have a student discount. You’ll be delighted to know that answer is usually, “Yes.�? Most of these places don’t advertise that they even have a discount, but for asking the question, (and having the ID to back it,) often means savings for you.

Here’s a list of some of the good ones (in participating outlets and locations):
