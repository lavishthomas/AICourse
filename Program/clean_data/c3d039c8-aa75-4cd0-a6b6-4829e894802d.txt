If you’re having a hard time deciding which stuff in your basement you should get rid of, ask yourself, “Would I buy this again today?” If you wouldn’t, it might be time to get rid of it.

As personal finance site The Minimalists points out, we accumulate a lot of stuff that we have no real interest in keeping. When it’s sitting in your basement, though, it’s already paid for. Tossing it out is a pure loss, which can skew how you value it. However, imagine if your basement were a store. Would you pay again to take it to your “home” upstairs?

What do you own that you don’t enjoy? If you could start over, would you buy those items again today? If not, then perhaps today is the day to let go.

When you run your junk through that filter, it’s easier to decide what to get rid of. Sure, you don’t want to get rid of the old exercise bike you already paid for. On the other hand, if it’s gathering dust in the basement you almost certainly wouldn’t buy it again today. So, it’s probably okay to let it go.
