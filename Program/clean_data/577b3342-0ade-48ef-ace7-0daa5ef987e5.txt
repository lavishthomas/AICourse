For truly elite athletes in the twenty first century, traditional training is no longer enough. To go from being just great to being the best in the world, it’s now essential to optimize every bit of performance. So in addition to relying on their coaches and teammates, athletes work with biomechanists, physiologists, psychologists, nutritionists, strength coaches, recovery experts, and statistical analysts.

In short, science and technology have become an integral part of an athlete’s quest to reach new frontiers of accomplishment. Assembling a group of sports scientists and coaches used to be beyond the realm of possibility for most athletes, but now the existence of national sports institutes and commercial sponsors allows it to happen regularly, across any sport you can think of.

WIRED and SI have teamed up to visit some of the leaders in the world of sports science, to see what the next 50 years of science-driven performance might look like.
