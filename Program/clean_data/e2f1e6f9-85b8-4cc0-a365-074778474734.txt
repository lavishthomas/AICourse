You'll thank your lucky stars for this!

There's no doubt when it comes to sex, we think you're worthy, nay entitled, to the very best, the most crazy sex possible ALL THE TIME! Right? Well, we think the universe agrees with us.

We know people tend to follow horoscopes to figure out their forecast for love and money, but why can't we also use astrology to forecast better sex too? So, we decided to put two and two together and figure out the best zodiac sex positions for each astrological sign.

When you take the zodiac into consideration, you can find out a lot about your partner's likes and dislikes, including what turns him on (and off) in bed. Is your partner a passionate lover? Is your partner more crazy and experimental? Does your partner think foreplay is really important? Believe it or not, all these intimate questions can be answered just by studying each zodiac sign's preferences.
