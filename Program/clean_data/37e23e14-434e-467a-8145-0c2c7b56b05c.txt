Even those of us who love cooking can succumb to the temptation of frozen, easy-to-prepare microwavable burritos and wraps. Fortunately, with a little prep time and the right ingredients, you too can trade in pre-made burritos for good in exchange for ones that are easy to make, freeze well, and give you complete control over what's inside.

Over at The Kitchn, they suggest some ingredients that take well to freezing, like roasted vegetables and roasted meats, like roasted potatoes, shredded beef, or pulled pork—anything that's you've cooked once that will still be delicious once reheated. After all, they say—and we agree—that if it doesn't taste that great to begin with, freezing it and reheating it isn't going to make it much better. They also note that fresh vegetables, like fresh tomatoes or lettuce, don't take well to freezing either.

They also suggest that the ideal way to freeze your wraps once you've made them is to wrap them in foil, then tightly wrap them again in plastic wrap. Doing both may create a lot of waste, but it ensures that your precious burritos aren't exposed to freezer air, and your food doesn't spoil or get freezer burned before you get a chance to eat it. Reheat your burritos gently, and they make a tasty anytime meal, either in a lunchbox at the office or a lazy night at home.

This isn't the first time we've talked about the benefits of freezing wraps—one of my favorite Lifehacker posts is this old one about making your own freezable breakfast burritos. Do you make your own burritos and wraps, and keep them in the freezer for future use, or are you just not a wrap person at all? Share your favorite wrap fillings in the comments.
