The Murders In The Rue Morgue by Edgar Allan Poe, considered to be the first modern detective story, was published in the USA on April 20, 1841. In this article, first published in January 2009, author Joanne Harris celebrates the psychological complexity of his Gothic tales.

I first became acquainted with the works of Edgar Allan Poe when I was eight or nine years old, and was immediately intrigued, partly because I’d been told the book was unsuitable and partly by the illustration on the cover, depicting a key moment from The Murders in the Rue Morgue.

In it, a giant ape brandishes an open razor in one hand and a torn-out clump of long blonde hair in the other. Its eyes roll so horribly, its teeth are bared so enticingly that I read the story, then the whole collection, with the result that I had nightmares for weeks and my mother thereafter banned all books of horror and fantasy from the house. That was my first introduction to Poe, and it was to lead to an enduring – if stormy – love affair.

In my youthful, Gothic incarnation as the author of The Evil Seed and Sleep, Pale Sister, I drew heavily on Poe’s stylistic influence as well as his life, and the result was two novels crammed with the most lurid prose, along with dusty hangings, deserted mansions, dark imaginings, grim forebodings, evil innocents and wraith?like femmes fatales, as well as a lot of bad sex. Girls, we have to love the Raven. If we don’t love him, then who else will? We owe him so much, after all – we, the daughters of Lilith, of Eve, of Hecate, not to mention Isis and Persephone, Kali the Destroyer and, of course, the Furies, whom he led such a merry dance before they got him in the end.
