Back in July, Twitter launched a really nifty analytics dashboard. A bit like Google Analytics for tweets, it allows you to gauge the performance of each and every tweet you sent. How many people saw it? How many of those actually clicked your links?

There was one catch, though: it was only open to advertisers and verified users.

No longer! Now you too can obsess way too hard over the performance of every tweet you send! Hurray!

News of the change comes from Twitter front end engineer Ian Chan:

Absolutely thrilled to open up access to http://t.co/wcU6oj9hFM to EVERYONE. Check it out, and let us know what you think! — Ian Chan (@chanian) August 27, 2014

and this page lurking in Twitter’s support base confirms it: the dashboard should now be open to every account that has been open for at least 14 days, isn’t restricted/protected/suspended, and (curiously) that primarily tweets in English, French, Japanese, or Spanish.

You can find the newly unlocked analytics dashboard right here.
