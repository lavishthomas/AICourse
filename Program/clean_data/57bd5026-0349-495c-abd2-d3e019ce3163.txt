Photographer Sasha Maslov has tracked down more than 100 Second World War veterans over the last decade - and has travelled around the world to photograph them at home. Among his subjects are a Japanese pilot who was recruited at just 14, a German officer who risked execution by his own country to help his men, and a heroic British SAS commando. Here he shares some of their remarkable stories
