Since the 1970's Majuli islander Jadav Payeng has been planting trees in order to save his island. To date he has single handedly planted a forest larger than Central Park NYC. His forest has transformed what was once a barren wasteland, into a lush oasis.



Humble yet passionate and philosophical about his work. Payeng takes us on a journey into his incredible forest.
