If you’re putting off a checkup or a tetanus booster because you think you’d have to pay a ton for it, we have good news. Even if you haven’t met your deductible, you still don’t have to pay a cent for most common types of preventive care.

Deductibles Don’t Work the Way You Might Think

Health insurance deductibles work very differently than car insurance deductibles. With a car, you have to cough up a certain amount of money before insurance will kick in—it’s a straightforward matter of numbers. So if somebody busts your headlight, you’ll pay for it out of pocket, because calling up your insurance company won’t bring you any benefit. You probably hope you never have to use your auto insurance at all—and if you’re a safe driver, and very lucky, maybe you won’t.

But it’s not realistic to expect to never use health insurance. Almost everybody needs some medical care, even if it’s just a checkup. There are two reasons why getting care, even with a high deductible, doesn’t cost as much as you would think:

The insurance company can usually get you a lower rate than if you told the provider you would pay cash. Maybe an office visit costs $250, but the negotiated rate is $100. You still have to pay the $100, but the other $150 disappears into thin air. Better yet, the law requires most insurance plans to pay for certain preventive care with no cost to you. That’s no copays, coinsurance, or deductible charges. Actually free.

OK, nothing is free, so really it’s included in your premium. That means your plan already includes that checkup whether you get one or not—so don’t use cost as an excuse to put it off.

The Stuff You Don’t Have to Pay For

Here’s a partial list of what’s free to you, so long as you get it from an in-network provider. In general, checkups are free: adults get one annual physical without cost, plus you’ll see below that the care involved in a well-child visit or a woman’s annual gynecologist visit is also covered for free.

A major caveat: Some insurance plans are considered grandfathered and don’t have to offer the benefits below for free. (They might still be covered, but that’s up to the plan.) Grandfathered plans are slowly dying off, but 25 percent of people with employer-sponsored health insurance (so, roughly 11 percent of Americans) still had one in 2015, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

A plan that is otherwise not grandfathered might still be considered grandfathered for the starred items on the women’s health care list below. That’s because these recommendations were added later, so they got their own special grandfathering date. If you can’t tell from the plan’s website whether your plan is grandfathered or whether the care you want is fully covered, call up the number on your card and ask.

Here’s the list of no-cost care, straight from the Department of Health and Human Services (we’ve edited lightly for clarity):
