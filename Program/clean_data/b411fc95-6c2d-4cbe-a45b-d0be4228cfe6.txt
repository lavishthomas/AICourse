Are you in your late twenties/early thirties and feeling confused? It could be ~the planets~.

Were you born between 1985 — 1988? If so: welcome to your first Saturn Return. "Saturn return" is an astrological phenomenon thought to occur when the planet Saturn returns to the same point in the sky it was in when you were born. These "returns" signify a person's transition into a new stage of life. Most of us will experience at least two returns: between the ages of 28-31 and between 56-60. Some may even reach a third (84-90), though a fourth remains extremely unlikely (114-118). The first Saturn Return, 28-31, is thought to be the time at which we leave youth behind, and enter true adulthood. Understandably, this is a stressful and confusing time for many of us. In order to understand what on Saturn (haha, get it) is happening to those of us entering our first return, and in hopes we can make it slightly less terrible for everyone, we spoke to astrologers and authors Tali and Ophira Edut, otherwise known as the AstroTwins.

But first, you may be wondering: when exactly will Saturn Return happen to me? It's a little bit of a math problem to figure out the exact dates, but Tali and Ophira have made it easier for you with the chart at the bottom of this page. In the left column, find the date on or closest to your birthday, before it. So if you, like Harry Styles, were born on February 1, 1994, your corresponding date would be Jan 28, 1994 — Saturn in Pisces. Next, scroll down the list until that same sign (here, Pisces) reappears. Share On email Share On email

But let's say you're already in it. What does Saturn Return ~mean~ for you? "The first Saturn return is kind of like a cosmic Bar Mitzvah," say the AstroTwins. "It's when you really start to feel like a 'grown-up.' It can be a two-year period of hard work, paying dues and figuring out what we want to do with our lives for the next 28 years or so. Often there will be shake-ups and obstacles that are designed to build character. We may end up doing something totally new for work, unrelated to college degree or prior experience. It's also a time that prepares us for leadership, but it can be a painful transition/in-between point." Share On email Share On email

How can we prepare for our Saturn return? According to the AstroTwins: "Start by humbling thyself. No matter how many degrees, coups or accolades you may have, the Saturn return reminds us that there's no substitute for life experience. Don't dim your light, but DO be aware that other amazing people have come before you. On the flip side, you may suddenly feel daunted, comparing yourself negatively to your peers. Remember that Saturn is all about rolling up your sleeves and building your new identity, brick by brick. This may be a time that you take a transitional job or some 'bridge' jobs while you seek further training or experience. Also, do NOT rush into getting married or engaged, or buying a house, or doing anything else permanent. People go through so much evolution that it's best not to rush into anything TOO 'adult' unless you feel completely ready. And if you have second thoughts or get cold feet, listen to that inner guidance. Haste makes waste during the slow-and-steady Saturn return!" Share On email Share On email

How can we minimize the inevitable drama of Saturn return? The AstroTwins: "As fellow Sagittarius Winston Churchill said, 'If you're walking through hell, keep walking.' Some things may end or expire during this time, and the task is not to force them to linger on. Patience is also a mighty antidote. A grounded and accepting attitude can work wonders. Meditation, personal growth classes, self-help books… whatever gives you a new framework and perspective for understanding life — and rolling with its punches — can be great. An older person, perhaps a mentor in their late 30s on up, can also give a huge dose of perspective. Look for bigger opportunities. Don't be the big fish in a small pond; challenge yourself to grow and even to learn how to fail." Share On email Share On email

Please tell us there's a light at the end of the tunnel. "Saturn always leaves us a parting gift as a reward for paying our dues," say the AstroTwins. "Know that you are not struggling in vain it's all going to pan out, leaving you wiser and more self-affirming. You could really establish yourself as a force to be reckoned with by the end of this cycle!" Share On email Share On email
