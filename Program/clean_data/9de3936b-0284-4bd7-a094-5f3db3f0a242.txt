Created By Voltier Creative Infographic Marketing

Why would Voltier do this? The key is in how the Infographic is utilized. Do you notice the link back to their site that states Infographic Marketing? That’s a keyword phrase that Voltier would like to be ranked on… so as the Infographic is published from site to site, backlinks are published for that keyword… this will drive up Voltier’s ranking for any searches for that keyword combination!

It’s an SEO tactic that works beautifully! The trick is to make an Infographic worth mentioning, though. The research and development that goes into Infographics is time-consuming and expensive. If you’re going to make one, you best make it count. Pricing can range up over $3k per Infographic for a well-researched and well-developed one.
