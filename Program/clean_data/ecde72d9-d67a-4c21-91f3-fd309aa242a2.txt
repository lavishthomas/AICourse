If you have a little room in your backyard for a garden, or even a space for a container garden outside your window, you may struggle with what you should plant for the amount of light you get. Well, good news: It doesn't matter how much light you get. Here are some suggestions for your plot or container garden that will work in sun or shade.

Our friends at Food52 have an excellent guide to plants that grow in any level of lightâ€”all you have to do is pick the ones you have the space and desire to grow. For example, if you have an especially sunny backyard, your options are broader, but tomatoes, beans peppers, zucchini, and potatoes all fare especially well in bright, direct light.

If you live in an urban environment or don't get a lot of sun where you'd like to plant, you still have options. Leafy greens, like the salad box we suggested a little while ago, grow very well without a lot of direct light. Fresh herbs like chervil, marjoram, thyme, and even arugula all grow well even in the shade. Do you have a plot in the shade? Planning a garden? What are you planting? Let us know in the comments below.
