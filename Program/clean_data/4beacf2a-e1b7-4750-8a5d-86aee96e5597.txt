Our readers labeled the Instant Pot as their favorite slow cooker, and Kitchn reviewed (and loved) it last year. Now that we've established our fandom, it's time to find even more delicious recipes that make the most of this trendy appliance. A love as big as this deserves an equally long list of things to make.

As you probably already know, the Instant Pot is a seven-gadgets-in-one appliance. Where the Instant Pot really stands out, however, is in its ability to be a slow cooker and a pressure cooker at the same time. That's why, for this recipe roundup, we're focusing on those two functionalities.

Pressure Cooker Recipes

You can make any regular pressure cooker recipe in your Instant Pot by using the "manual" mode and adding 15 percent more cooking time. For example, if a recipe says it takes 10 minutes, you'll want to cook it for 11 to 12 minutes instead. This is because most pressure cookers operate with 15 psi, but the Instant Pot operates at 11.6 psi.

Slow Cooker Recipes

The default slow cooker time is four hours for the Instant Pot. Make sure to adjust time and temperature (low, medium, high) before starting. Remember to adjust the steam release handle to "venting" when using your Instant Pot as a slow cooker.
