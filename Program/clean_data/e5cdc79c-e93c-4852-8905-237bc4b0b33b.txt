The snowball method is the best way to pay down your debt. If you’re skeptical and want to see how it will work, this spreadsheet will calculate exactly how long it will take to be debt free.

When you’re paying off debt with the snowball method, you start by focusing on the smallest debt balance, then moving on to the larger ones. This spreadsheet, from personal finance site Life and My Finances lets you add all of your debts to one sheet. Then, you can add how much extra you can pay towards your debts each month, as well as a one-time initial debt payment. It will then automatically calculate how many months it will take you to pay off each debt.
