Oh, my friends. You have such hate in your dark hearts. So much anger for the cars. And I love every bit of it.



Last week, I asked you guys for the cars you irrationally, irrevocably and unreasonably hated. Not brands, specific models. I was looking for some searing, nuclear-fire hot takes. The takes that would melt steel beams.

For those of you hating on the PT Cruiser or a Prius, your resounding response has been heard. What else do you hate? Let’s dive into the filth.
