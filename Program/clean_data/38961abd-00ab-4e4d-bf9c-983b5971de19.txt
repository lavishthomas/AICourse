A low-level deck beautifies your outdoor space and can increase the value of your home. And it might not be as difficult to DIY as you might think.

The Home Depot Blog offers instructions on building a deck with just $900-worth of materials (as opposed to paying someone for nearly 10x that much). You’ll need pressure-treated beams, concrete deck piers, 2x4s (in this case, Douglas Fir wood), wood sealer, and other assorted materials and carpentry tools. And a good deal of time.
