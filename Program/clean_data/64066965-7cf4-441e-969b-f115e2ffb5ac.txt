We rationalize away what's bothering us when we want a relationship to work. But weblog Her Campus says that chances are, the things we rationalize are the biggest problems that can hurt our relationships in the end.

Making excuses for your partner is typically a bad habit to adopt. It belittles your own feelings and gut instincts, when it's likely they're perfectly valid. Start a dialogue with your partner about the problem instead of rationalizing it away. The least you will do is get some answers about whether it's time to call it quits or not. You will also gain some real insight about your partner's perspective to help you really understand the big picture. The best outcome is that you both will reach and understanding and consensus about how to resolve the problem going forward. Either way, rationalizing is just prolonging the process to resolution, and setting you up to resent them down the line.
