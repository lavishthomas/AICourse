The wildlife photojournalist award: single image winner: Broken cats by Britta Jaschinski (Germany/UK).

Big cats perform at the Seven Star Park in Guilin, China. They have had their teeth and claws pulled out, and when not in the arena, they live in the tiny cages visible behind the stage. For the past 20 years, Britta has travelled extensively, documenting the world of animals in captivity. But never, she says, has she come across ‘such brutal and systematic deprivation’ as in China.
