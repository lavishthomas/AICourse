Nicholas writes: My wife had an insane childhood. Her father made her sneak into other people’s gardens to steal orchids so he could sell them. A family friend would come and go, with tales of faking Scud missile launches in Iraq. Not to mention long-ago connections with the Crowninshields, the money long run out. She doesn’t want to embarrass her relatives. But I think she should write a book.

This court will never compel someone to write a memoir. Frankly, there are enough of them (including my own, ‘‘Vacationland,’’ coming this October). I’m fascinated, however, by your wife’s childhood. You may even have created a new literary genre: microbiography. Maybe you should write another 70-word chapter, bringing us up to the present. Quick edit: The line about the Crowninshield family a) doesn’t make sense, and b) is not a sentence.
