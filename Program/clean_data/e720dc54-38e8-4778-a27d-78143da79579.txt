Sometimes slow cooker food has a reputation of being a bit bland. I mean, it makes sense when you think about it. Using a slow cooker is convenient for sure, but when you combine everything in one vessel to cook, it's bound to come out a little ... one-note.

Well, this recipe for apricot chicken gives you the best of both worlds. With a few little tricks you can have a set-it-and-forget-it meal that's packed with flavor and color. I promise!

This goes against the low-effort nature of a slow cooker recipe, but to get that crispy skin on your chicken thighs, you need to take a few moments to sear it on both sides in a skillet on the stovetop first. The additional time will be more than worth it when you pull beautifully golden-brown chicken out of the slow cooker later. While you're searing the chicken you also throw some thinly sliced onion in the skillet with it. This just gives the onions a head start on softening; they'll continue to melt down and release their natural sweetness in the slow cooker.

The real key to big flavor here, though, is the sauce. A mixture of apricot preserves, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, and fresh ginger, it strikes the perfect balance of sweet, salty, tangy, and spicy.

Served with some cooked rice and roasted broccoli (or a simple green salad), this chicken is anything but boring. Serve it to any slow cooker skeptics next time they come over for dinner.
