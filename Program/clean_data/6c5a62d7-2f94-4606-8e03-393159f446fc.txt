To the Editor:

Re “A Feminist Defense of Bridezillas” (Sunday Review, Aug. 6): Kelsey McKinney writes that women are unfairly labeled “bridezillas” for simply organizing their weddings.

Ms. McKinney lists things that brides must be on top of, like choosing what flowers are flown in on ice to match the ties, their vows and the dance songs. She also writes that the risk of poor planning or lack of sufficient enthusiasm includes an “anemic hashtag.”

Women don’t have to do any of this. None of this is about the ceremony, the joining before God, or even the guests’ having fun.

When I got married, I did not write my own vows, because I had a religious service; I gave the florist some general colors; I trusted my bridesmaids with their own dresses; and I let my mother and caterer work out the food. Many people have told me it was the best wedding they ever attended because it was relaxed and they were happy for me.
