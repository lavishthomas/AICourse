Through his work, Andrew says he hopes to give viewers a greater appreciation for the small moments.

"We're all so busy and caught up in everything that we forget about the little moments that are important -- myself included," he said. "Drawing HJ-Story for me is not only to capture the moments of a relationship, but to remind me of the little moments that are easily forgotten."
