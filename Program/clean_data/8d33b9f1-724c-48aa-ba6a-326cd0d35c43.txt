Texas Tornado Cake is spectacular. What a delicious and easy sheet cake to make! The cake is made with a can of fruit cocktail in the batter, then before you bake the cake you sprinkle a streusel topping with nuts over the top. After the cake comes out of the oven you add a boiled coconut topping and pour it on the cake while hot. Oh, soooo scrumptious!

This wonderfully quick and easy recipe is also quite economical as you get 15 or so servings out of the cake for less than $10. If you have coconut and nuts on hand all the time like I do, it will cost even less. I was trying to use up some half-and-half in my refrigerator and I even had a can of fruit cocktail in my pantry so I didn‚Äôt need to go to the store for any ingredients when I made this tasty cake recipe.

Years ago, in the early 1980s when our children were infants, Sandi Weikel brought this cake to a Sunday school fellowship our class was having. Granted, I have a sweet anyway so it‚Äôs rare when I don‚Äôt like something sweet, but I took one bite of this sweet cake and knew I had to have the recipe.

I have made this recipe so many times over the years for two basic reasons‚Äìokay, three! 1) I almost always have all the ingredients on hand so I can make it on the fly. 2) It really is so inexpensive to make. 3) It tastes great! I love all the peaches and pears in the fruit cocktail. I love coconut. I love walnuts or pecans (any kind of nut for that matter), so this has always been a win-win for me. It‚Äôs a win-win for my husband, too, because he hates dry desserts, and quite frankly, he rarely touches any dessert that doesn‚Äôt have fruit in it. He would much rather eat a dessert with fruit than chocolate. (Go figure!) So this tasty cake recipe has been on our ‚Äúto-make‚Äù list lots of times over the years.

I‚Äôm not sure how the recipe got it‚Äôs name. The Weikels and our family were both living in Florida at the time and neither of us had ever been to Texas! I assume that Sandy got this recipe from her mom and it was passed down in some way. The cake doesn‚Äôt actually look like a tornado hit it (at least I don‚Äôt think it does!) Be that as it may, I present to you Texas Tornado Cake‚Äìlovely, delicious, moist, and sumptuous.

If you‚Äôre looking for a quick and easy dessert for your family, Texas Tornado Cake should top your list! It‚Äôs really a fabulous recipe. Dollop some vanilla or Snickerdoodle Ice Cream over the top and you will be in seventh heaven! You and your family will savor each mouthful, all the while vanilla ice cream dribbles down your chin! üôÇ

Here‚Äôs what I did.

Measure sugar into a large mixing bowl. Add eggs.

Add a can of UNDRAINED fruit cocktail. You need all the juice and syrup.

Add baking soda and UNBLEACHED all-purpose flour. Bleached flour toughens baked goods.

Stir ingredients with a wooden spoon to combine.

Pour into a 9√ó13‚Ä≥ glass baking dish that‚Äôs been sprayed with cooking spray.

Measure brown sugar into a small mixing bowl. Add chopped nuts.

Stir to combine.

Sprinkle the brown sugar-walnut streusel topping over top of the cake batter.

Bake at 325 about 40 minutes. Remove from oven.

While cake is baking make Boiled Coconut Icing: Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over a medium heat. Add half-and-half cream, heavy whipping cream, or evaporated milk. You need the thicker consistency‚Äìnot regular milk.

Add coconut.

Add brown sugar.

Stir to combine. Bring ingredients to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Here the icing is done. Remove from heat and pour the hot mixture over the cake while the cake itself is still warm.

Here I‚Äôve poured the Boiled Coconut Icing over top of the hot cake fresh from the oven.

Here‚Äôs a close up so you can see the texture. Allow the cake to cool completely before cutting.

To serve the cake: Insert spatula into sections and remove to dessert plates. Eat and enjoy! This luscious cake tastes fantastic!
