When I was 17, I had a summer job making ice cream at Peter’s on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. It was a cinch. You poured the milky contents of a container labeled “base” into the machine, added your flavorings (chocolate, vanilla, kiwi or what have you) and turned the switch.

I discovered that ice cream making (and the critical task of frequently tasting it) was one of the most enjoyable, creative things a person could get paid to do on a sultry day. The possible flavor combinations are infinite, and endlessly satisfying. And while my guanabana-chocolate chunk was not as successful as my mocha-caramel-almond, it was just as thrilling to mix.

Although I know a lot more about making ice cream now than I did then, the fundamental lesson is the same. As long as you start with a good ice cream base and add excellent ingredients, you can make any flavor in the universe: almond, basil, lime. It’s also going to taste a whole lot better than any you can buy.

There are many kinds of ice cream bases, ranging from the simplest mix of cream and sugar to more elaborate combinations including xanthan or guar gum, corn syrup and milk powder.

Here I offer a classic custard base using egg yolk. Yolks vastly improve the texture of ice cream, especially the kind made in small batches in home machines. (Industrial machines, like the gurgling goliath at Peter’s, are another animal.) It acts as an emulsifier, keeping ice crystals at bay and making home-churned ice creams scoopable even after they’ve firmed up in the freezer. The yolk, along with the cream, also gives the luscious mouth feel of a great ice cream, that tongue-coating velvet you just don’t get from sorbet.
