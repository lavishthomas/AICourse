How To Lose Weight Fast & Easy w/ NO EXERCISE.





PRECAUTIONS:

+ Green Tea can cause slight seizures, although he population that carries this rare symptom is rather less, it is still a duty to advise you on it. Before starting the Greentea/Oolong Tea abby diet, i prefer you have a cup or two and see if another amounts.

+ Green Tea can cause slight dizziness, feelings of vomiting, nausea, headache etc.. if you follow my steps exactly in the video you can very well avoid these symptoms easily. Do not take green tea for granted and drink more cups a day than I said, and do not have it on an empty stomach unless you have tried it once and had no reactions whatsoever (like me) in which cases when your in a rush to head off somewhere, those who can withstand it on an empty stomach, it is ok to do so, but do not do it everyday, and more than once in a day, even if you know you have or CAN handle it due to experience.



MOST ASKED QUESTION - Whats My Height, Age, and Weight.

Height:

161.5cm - 5ft 3inches - grew an inch after weight loss, was 5"2 all my life till 17.

Age:

May 05 1994 - Its 2014 - I Turned 20 this year :/ BYEBYE TEEN LIFE D:

Weight:

My weight Fluctuates every now and then, Mainly because I am a woman, and we do have weight fluctuations quite frequently, also my body *morph* type is prone to fluctuations.

Iam currently 60-63kgs, but mostly stay at 61 & 62. 63 being the highest in the middle of my monthly's for the most.



HOW MANY CALORIES SHOULD YOU EAT?

I personally eat 1200 cals a day but thats for my height, This doesn't apply to everyone as all women come in different shapes and sizes. What i can recommend is for you to find out your BMI and it will calculate everything for you depending on your height. Some people who saw my video got mistaken and assumed I've told all women to eat UNDER 1000 Cals, including men. In order to reduce the amount of assumptions i get and unnecessary notification that are rather unimportant as even me making a video falls of def ears to a few tempered humans, i thought of adding this into my description. Type into your "Google Toolbar" for a BMI calculator, and you shall be presented with one online. Also, notice how i said don't starve yourself. If i would say that, it would be so incoherent to saying to eat under 1000 cals which literally is STARVING YOURSELF.



WHAT DID I SAY AT 11:20-11:25?

I said "SOUP" can fill you Up. (btw soups with creams are Fattening).



Foods That will help you see results in 2 weeks:

Lemon / Lime

Pineapples

Apples

Prunes (After or Before every meal {CAN ALSO BE USED FOR SNACKING).

GreenTea ( For 3 - 4 months [MORNING + LATE AFTERNOON + EVENING] half an hour after every meal.

Oolong Tea / Wulong Tea (After 3 - 4 months). half an hour after every meal.

Honey + Lemon + Hot Water (Before Sleeping).



TIPS & WARNINGS:

Green Tea & Oolong is best from either a traditional Chinese market/store or Walmart.

Do not add too much honey to your prior sleep drink because it can cause heartburn as normal honey does.

Do not Eat over 5 - 6 Prunes a day. It might cause irritation to your bowl movement.

Do not go overboard with Pineapples and Apples just because it helps burn fat. Everything should be eaten in healthy quantities. Fruits can cause uncomfortable bloating or a beautiful gassy BUM!!! hahahaha

Eat frozen yogurt instead of regular Ice cream.



Hope I haven't missed out any important Tips or Additional Information.
