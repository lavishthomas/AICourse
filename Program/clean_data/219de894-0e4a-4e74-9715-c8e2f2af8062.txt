Behold one of the most incredible do-it-yourself Voltron models I’ve ever seen. I’m willing to bet the same is true for you.



Designed by a Korean model-maker known as “Juny,” this Voltron is made up of three hundred and forty 3D printed parts. The metallic paint job is, in particular, spectacular.
