makeup PARTY MAKEUP INSPIRATION

Each time you get dressed up to go out, you have many different eye makeup options… it really just depends on your mood and outfit! You can draw a cat eye, you can leave them bare to keep the focus on a bold lip, you can rim the inner waterline, you can do a classic smoky eye, or… you can do a Sparkle Smudge! It’s dramatic and ultra-feminine and very compliment-heavy. So add this option to your repertoire and I trust you’ll bring it out on the perfect occasion! Here’s how:

TOOLS:

Longwear Eyeliner Pencil: You can use a kohl pencil as well, but when you smudge it, it’s going to dissipate too much, so I recommend using a longwear pencil so it’s more intense and lasts longer. Try Laura Mercier Longwear Creme Eye Pencil in Espresso or Wet N Wild Megalast Eye Pencil in Black/Brown.

in Espresso or in Black/Brown. Sparkle Shadow: I used Bobbi Brown Sparkle Eyeshadow on Lexi above because it’s the perfect amount of sparkle without getting showgirl.
