Our philosophy of prioritising quality and durability when choosing materials ensures creations unique to Convoy. We work from a tiny industrial design studio in Malaysia where our design team revise and iterate each design until the final creation is ready for our in-house production. In-house manufacturing, assembly and packaging ensures that that the best processes and materials available are used during the production process. Every creation is humbly packed and sealed before it leaves our studio to you.
