Post content to LinkedIn that you think will help your followers become more successful professionals and you’ll be more likely to convert them into loyal viewers.

Step 3: Tweak Your Summary A few rules of thumb from the information compiled by Link Humans: Make your summary keyword rich

Use the first-person

Add some contact details

Throw in some relevant media links

Step 4: Revamp Your Experience Section Perhaps the most obvious section you’ll want to keep updated is your experience section, since this is one of the first things employers will skim–it’s the closest thing you get to an online resume. While you should certainly be descriptive, be careful about what keywords you choose to use. Steer clear of buzzwords like utilize, optimize, cutting-edge, team player, and liaisoned–that one’s not even a word. You can also add media to each of your job experiences in this section and showcase the recommendations you’ve received for particular positions.

Step 5: Include Some Projects You’re Proud Of LinkedIn’s Director of Product Management Christina Allen writes that adding compelling projects to your profile can demonstrate experience relevant to your professional goals. Why not add links to show them off even more?
