These crock pot grape jelly meatballs are a family favorite. They are seriously so good and the perfect appetizer for game day! They almost remind me of sweet and sour meatballs but taste better! My Grandpa has been making them for years and we always loved them growing up. My sister even talked him into making them as an appetizer at her wedding. Everyone loved them! Now of course my family has their actual “homemade meatballs” which are amazing and I’ll have to that recipe soon. The best part about these bbq meatballs is no one would ever know they were so simple to make. You could even turn them into a main dish and serve them over sticky rice. YUM!

I love getting the meatballs from Costco or Kroger. They taste the best in my opinion. And sweet baby ray’s BBQ sauce is my personal favorite. :)
