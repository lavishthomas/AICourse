There’s something endearing about films that look like they cost $100 million but really cost $20 million. The audience can just tell every single cent went into making the film look and feel bigger than it should. Usually, even if the movie isn’t great, that passion comes through.

We don’t know how much The Osiris Child: Science Fiction Volume One cost, but there’s no question it’s one of those movies. Directed by Shane Abbess, the film puts a ton of familiar scifi tropes into a blender. The result is a highly entertaining film that doesn’t take itself too seriously but always looks like it does. Scene after scene of creatures, effects, and actors feel like they belong in a bigger movie. And, in this exclusive behind-the-scenes video, you see that’s exactly what everyone involved was going for.

The Osiris Child, which we reviewed last year, will have its US premiere exclusively on Direct TV September 7. It’ll then come to theaters, VOD and on-demand October 6. Abbess and crew really do craft an “endangered species” of film here, mixing big-budget ideas with impressive effects to give audiences blockbuster-sized fun at a fraction of the cost.
