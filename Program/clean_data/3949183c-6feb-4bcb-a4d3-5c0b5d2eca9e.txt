Traveling can be one of the most important, most memorable life experiences (especially if you're a student and study abroad). But what if you can't afford to globe-trot or go on a road trip? The Telegraph outlines ten ways you can travel for freeâ€”including getting an organization to fund your trip.

Believe it or not, some organisations exist with the sole purpose of funding travel. To cash in on this generosity, you'll need to present a clear, considered plan and persuade a board of people that your trip is worthwhile. Many organisations value trips that will enhance personal or cultural development, but each has its own specifications and criteria. The SPRET educational trust caters specifically for students based in certain areas, whereas UNESCO and the UN both offer more general funding to travellers.

The article is targeted towards students, and many travel grants are focused on educational purposes, but you might be able to find a travel grant even if you're not in school. In addition to the sources mentioned in the quote above, About.com's Student Travel site has a list of travel grants with brief descriptions of them.
