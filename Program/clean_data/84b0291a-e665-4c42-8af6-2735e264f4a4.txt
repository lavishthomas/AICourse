Yoga is more dangerous than previously thought and causes as many injuries as other sports, a study has found.

The 5,000 year-old Indian discipline is said to boost physical and mental wellbeing, and celebrity fans include Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen - as well as David and Victoria Beckham.

However, in a recent study yoga caused musculoskeletal pain - mostly in the arms - in more than one in ten participants.
