Ties are a must when you want to look your best in a suit, but with so many different styles of each, it can be tough to match things just right. The trick is matching the width of the suit's lapel with the tie.

This graphic from The Compass, menswear provider Black Lapel's blog, explains what widths you want to match up. The widest part of the tie should be the same width as the widest part of your suit's lapel. Some suits look better with skinnier ties and vice versa, and now you know why. There are a lot of good tips for wearing a tie right, but this simple rule will at least ensure that you're off to a good start. If ties and suits aren't your thing, though, you can always go for fashionable scarves instead.
