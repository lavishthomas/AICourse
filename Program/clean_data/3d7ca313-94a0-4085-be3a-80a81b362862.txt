I’m just tickled pink when it’s autumn ‘cause I love me some winter squash, especially kabocha! When cooked, this Japanese pumpkin has the taste and texture of roasted chestnuts. Even uber-picky Lil-O will swipe roasted slices off the communal plate and gobble them down. I normally keep the skin on when I roast them but if you’ve got autoimmune issues, peel them.

Here’s what I gathered to feed 4 people as a side dish:

1 medium kabocha squash

2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted

Kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

Here’s how I made it:

I preheated the oven to 400 F, rinsed the squash under running water, and dried it. (If you’re gonna peel it, do so now with a sharp vegetable peeler.)

Like all winter squash, kabocha takes a sharp knife and a bit of brute force to cut up. I’ve found that the best way to attack it is to cut off the top and the bottom…

…’cause once the flesh is exposed, cutting it in half is a breeze.

I scooped out the seeds…

…and cut the squash into thin wedges.

Next, I tossed the squash with the coconut oil and seasoned the slices with salt and pepper.

I put the squash in a single layer on a foil-lined baking tray…

…and popped it in the oven.

I roasted the squash for 30 minutes, flipping them over at the midpoint. The wedges are ready to eat when they’re slightly crunchy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside.
