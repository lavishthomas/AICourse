Mindfulness and meditation are well-known ways to combat anxiety and stress, but they can be hard to fit into a busy schedule. If you need a quick way to curb a stream of anxiety-inducing thoughts, try this grounding exercise that you can fit in no matter where you are.

Your goal with grounding meditation is to connect with whatever surface your body is touching. Rodale Wellness explains what you should do:

If you are in bed, feel the bed holding you firmly and completely. You are safe and held. If you are sitting, notice your sit bones as they rest against the chair or your seat on the train, bus, or car. Feel your foundation strong and stable. If you are standing, sense your feet in your socks and your socks in your shoes and feel those shoes upon the ground. Imagine the depth of the earth that is supporting you.

By re-focusing on what you’re physically feeling, you divert your mind away from anxious or stressful thoughts and into the moment. You can do this exercise wherever you are and spend as much time as you have on it, even if that’s only a minute. It may take a little practice, but you’ll soon be able to launch into this grounding practice anytime you feel stressed or unfocused and come out ready to tackle the task at hand.
