This actually happened with almost every dress I tried on. Once I was in each dress, my bridal consultant and the intern assisting her were laser-focused and sphinx-like. They asked questions ("How do you feel about the size of the skirt?") and they absorbed my nervous assessments ("hahahaha SO THIS SKIRT IS A LOT OF VOLUME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING") and they offered information about things that could be changed about the dress if it came up.

In retrospect, this strategy makes total sense: They need to get as much information about my feelings as fast as they can, and they can't do that if they don't give me space to talk. But I am someone who worries about being a bother, and so — for me — not being able to figure out if I was making someone frustrated or not was terrifying.
