Sheena Yaitanes has a zero-waste philosophy about makeup. “So many beauty products exist for no reason — they’re so unnecessary,” she says. Over late-night conversation with a friend and a cousin a few years ago, Yaitanes put this wildly simple idea on the table: “Someone should make a collection of all the necessary products — and that should be a brand.” Last October, Yaitanes took the task upon herself and launched Kosas, a super edited line of makeup basics. She started with lipsticks. “It was the area that always perturbed me the most, in terms of having an excess of colors,” the 32 year-old California native says. “I was like, ‘Let’s master this,’ because the potential for lipstick is so good — it’s all you really need on your face.”

An avid painter with a background in science, Yaitanes began mixing acrylic paints in the dining room of her Los Angeles home, determined to find a palette that would look good against any complexion. “My feeling is that a lot of nudes are made by mixing brown pigments with white pigments, and making a tan,” she says of why most beige lipsticks fall flat. “There’s not enough reds, blues and yellows underneath it, which is what you would do if painting someone’s skin.” The secret to formulas that “look human,” she says, hinges on color proportions. After tinkering for 12 months, she hit upon her current range of eight fuss-free shades — reds, plums and rosy neutrals (no beigey nudes) — that are just “really easy” to wear, she says.

Growing up in the Orange County suburbs, Yaitanes was schooled in makeup from an early age. Her parents immigrated from Iran to the U.S. in the ’70s, and her mother worked in department stores as a beauty counter representative for brands like Clarins and Clinique while studying mathematics. “She would have entire drawers full of lipsticks or eyeliner,” Yaitanes says. “I thought this was normal, until I would go to my friends’ houses, and see that their moms had like, one bag of makeup.” Yaitanes would spend hours playing with the bullets and wands, slicking on the nude lipsticks in the free-gift-with-purchase sets, which “across the board, would make you look worse,” she says. Yaitanes’s fascination with formulations led her to pursue biological sciences at the University of California, Irvine, where she discovered a love of organic chemistry. “You learned how to read a list of ingredients,” she says. “It was like deciphering a code.”

When it came to formulating her own lipsticks, Yaitanes knew her way around a lab. She prioritized eliminating unnecessary chemicals, such as parabens, phthalates and sulfates, from her batches. “But it became important for me to choose ingredients that weren’t just natural for the sake of being natural,” she says, “because a lot of natural ingredients can be harsh or sensitizing, too.” (The fact that her two-year-old daughter, Electra, has a severe tree nut allergy meant no almond oils, for example.) Instead, she opted for healing botanicals — rose hip, grapeseed oil and mango butter among them — that hydrate and impart a remarkably long-lasting stain. “The molecular weight of a natural oil is small so it can absorb into your skin, versus a synthetic that sits on top and slides off,” she explains. “That’s one of the cool surprises about this product.”

What’s not surprising is how quickly Kosas (which means “sheath” in Sanskrit) has taken off, especially among top-tier makeup artists who favor the line, including Monika Blunder and Lisa Storey. Yaitanes plans to release a blush-and-highlighter duo next year, with mascara, foundation and concealer to follow thereafter. Yet even as the brand continues to grow, she says, “The collection will always be concise and easy to navigate.”

And applying the products will never involve special steps. Yaitanes’s only rules for putting on lipstick are as follows: exfoliate your lips first, then slick on two coats — either straight from the tube or dabbed on with your finger. “And no lip liner, ever,” she says.
