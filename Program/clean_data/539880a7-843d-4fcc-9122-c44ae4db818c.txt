If you want your next vacation experience to come with pre-planned activities and dining options built-in, consider a cruise or an all-inclusive resort. If you can't decide which one you prefer, these tips will help you choose.

To be clear, this is a comparison between standard cruises (not luxury cruises) and all-inclusive resorts. Luxury cruises often include many things that are extra on a standard cruise, such as shore excursions.

You may like a cruise better if you don't plan to add extras, like shore excursions, to your trip. Cruises are usually cheaper because they expect most people will spend on extra activities like kayaking or snorkeling. All-inclusive resorts, on other hand, usually include more activities in the price. All that said, cruises depart from many US cities, which means travel will likely be cheaper, since all-inclusive resorts are usually outside the country.

Cruise Critic has compiled a pretty big list of differences between cruises and all-inclusive resorts, so check out the full posted linked below.
