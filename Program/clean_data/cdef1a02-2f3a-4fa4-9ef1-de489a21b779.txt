[UPDATED 9/9/14]

Here we are, at the final week of car announcements for Forza Horizon 2. This final reveal brings us to a total of 210 cars that have been built specifically for the next generation and Forza Horizon 2. All of the cars announced this week exude their own sense of style and charisma. The Land Rover Defender 90 is as rugged it gets. The form of the 2015 Mustang GT was designed for global appeal. The Lamborghini Veneno practically redefines extreme car design.

There is not much longer to wait until all these rides will be at your fingertips to leave your mark on the roads and countryside of Forza Horizon 2. Let’s dive in to this week’s list.

1968 Lancia Fulvia Coupé Rallye 1.6 HF

Sophistication and deliberately understated styling are the hallmarks of this highly desirable special version of the Lancia Fulvia. Lancia brought this homologated version — the Fanalone, referencing the Fulvia’s large driving lights—to enable Lancia’s entry into the World Rally Championship. Front-wheel drive and a healthy punch of more than 100 hp gave the Fulvia excellent performance. Sharp steering and excellent braking made it a natural candidate for rally competition. Under the direction of Cesare Fiorio, Lancia came to dominate rally in the late 1960s and early 1970s. You can tell a Rallye edition from its lesser brethren by its fiberglass fender flares and Campagnolo rims. If you look at the dash you will also see an oil temp gauge and adjustable redline on the tachometer. The Fulvia’s light weight gave it an advantage and this special model was further lightened by replacing the back seat with a shelf and installing lightweight bucket seats. Among Lancia Fulvia aficionados, the Rallye 1.6 is the crown jewel.

1993 Renault Clio Williams

Among hot hatches, the Renault Clio Williams holds accreditation by many motor journalists as one of the very best ever built. To accommodate homologation requirements, 2,500 Clio Williams needed to be produced. They were so popular 1,300 more were built and quickly sold out. More is better when it comes to the availability of this little hot hatch and Renault followed with the Williams 2 and 3 getting more than 12,000 models on the road before production finally ceased. Despite these numbers, finding an original street version is a rare thing, since many were used to replace damaged rally cars and others were broken for parts to keep rally versions in competition. The punch this tike packs is from a 2.0-liter straight four, stuffed under the diminutive bonnet with a bespoke four-into-one manifold, a stroked crank and other internal goodies. The Clio Williams is a car that will get a lot of looks from those who know it, and those who don’t will snap their necks when they hear it buzz past them.

1997 Land Rover Defender 90

Few vehicles are built with the ruggedness in mind of the Land Rover Defender. For decades, a Land Rover might have been the only vehicle that some people ever saw. That’s because for decades the Land Rover Series I and Series II were the only vehicles that dared to access the interiors of certain countries whose roads are little more than trails. Over the years not much has changed in the design of the Land Rover. Its mission is simple: devour any terrain thrown at it and keep the occupants reliably safe. The biggest change for the 1997 model was the introduction of the name Defender. Under the chassis, two live axles and full-time four-wheel drive give the Defender rock-crawling, river-fording, and mountain climbing abilities that are unmatched. For 1997, the last year the Defender was available in the U.S., you will find a potent V8 under the hood, accompanied by a four-speed automatic transmission. On the streets the Defender is no sprinter, but toss this Rover in the weeds and it will always come out on top.

2015 Ford Mustang GT

It’s been fifty years since this American automotive icon was introduced and effectively changed the domestic car market. The Mustang has been many things to many people and, through its many evolutions, it has been many things unto itself. Since the introduction of the more classically shaped Mustang in 2005, a rebirth of the Mustang took place. Now, ten years later, with a search for global-viability factoring in to the Mustang’s redesign, we still see the classic form but with some tweaks that distinguish this ‘Stang as something new. Under this new skin nearly every inch of the 2015 Mustang has been reengineered for efficiency, reliability, and performance. Under its aluminum hood, in between aluminum fenders that together offer 200 pounds of weight savings, the new V8 (in GT models) brings more than 400 ponies under the command of your right foot. Rear-wheel drive is a precious commodity the Mustang has always cornered the market with, and the new Mustang is happy as ever to light up the rear wheels, get tail-happy, or just delight you with its tendency for oversteer. Most of all though, this is a Mustang, and the passion that lights in the soul of Mustang lovers is reason enough to make it a favorite.

1984 Honda Civic CRX Mugen

The partnership between Honda and Mugen began with the CRX. It was an inevitable collaboration given that Mugen was formed by Hirotoshi Honda – the son of Honda founder Soichiro Honda – and veteran racer Masao Kimura. The CRX, or CR-X as it is called in Japan, carried an aggressive effort to establish Mugen in the United States. At the time, any Honda dealer could order and sell Mugen parts, and a select few became Mugen Performance Centers. The program only lasted three years, but yielded a handful of uprated Mugen CRXs and many street-tuned Hondas. Dressed in the Mugen body kit, the CRX’s short, stout lines are tastefully enhanced without complicating them. A trademark feature of the Mugen CRX is the twin-pipe muffler or “Silencer Set.” With nearly 120 horsepower, a limited slip differential, and weighing in at a mere 1,800 pounds, the Mugen CRX is a thrill to drive and inspired a new generation of Honda tuners. Mugen has gone on to contribute to Honda’s racing success in Formula One and sports car racing, but it all started here with the CRX.
