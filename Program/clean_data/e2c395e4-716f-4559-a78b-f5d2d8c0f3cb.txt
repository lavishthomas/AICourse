Salmon is one of my favorite dinners to make so I should be sharing it a lot more often. It’s generally very easy to prepare, it’s incredibly healthy (it even makes the superfood list) and it’s something I feel great about eating that will fill me up thanks to those healthy fats.

This salmon recipe is definitely going to be added to my rotation! It is deliciously flavorful and it’s a breeze to make. Not to mention, even my kids loved it! I love the tang of the dijon mustard paired with the sweetness of the honey along with a faint zip from the lemon zest. Then of course I love that crunch from the herbed and oiled Panko mixture. All of the aforementioned ingredients are perfect compliments to salmon, when you try it you’ll see what I mean.

Now I just need to go buy more salmon so I can make it again this coming week. Enjoy!
