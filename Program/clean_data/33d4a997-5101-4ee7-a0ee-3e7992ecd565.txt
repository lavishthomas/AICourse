Cinnamon-sugar toast may be firmly associated with your younger years, but in the above video from Tasting Table, the childhood classic gets a grown-up, but still very simple upgrade.

What makes this toast so special? Firstly, the bread. Instead of thin, flimsy white bread, this recipe uses thick slices of buttery brioche. Then thereâ€™s a ton of butter, cinnamon, and sugar (duh), but the real secret weapon is the cinnamon simple syrup, which is made with 1/2 a cup each of sugar and water and three cinnamon sticks. The syrup is brushed on after an initial frying in butter, permeating the bread and helping the cinnamon-sugar stick to the surface. All that tastiness goes back in the frying pan, where everything gets all crispy and caramelized for the best cinnamon-sugar toast of your life.
