The cave paintings Shan came upon in 1993 are believed to be far older, although they have not been carbon-dated, leading to some skepticism among ski historians that the paintings are truly as old as the Chinese researchers say they are. Two years ago, Shan organized a conference of leading historians from Scandinavia, North America and local Central Asian communities to share the histories of skiing from different parts of the world.

There is no consensus that any of the ethnic groups of the Altai can stake a claim as the rightful heirs of the painted skiers; thousands of years of conquest, including times when the region came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the mid-1700s, have left such a determination all but impossible. Nevertheless, the locals here have bristled under the idea that skiing could be claimed as the history of the country to which they owe their citizenship rather than the ethnic bloodlines to which they owe their heritage.

“Education is the way to ease tension,” Shan said. “Ten thousand years ago was still the Stone Ages, there was no minority diversity, no country borders. As a researcher, being tolerant of opinions different from one’s own is the most important thing.”

So far, Shan and his team of ski historians have done this work without much public fanfare. He believes recognition for Altai skiing’s history will grow as the 2022 Games approach, and he hopes that will lead to funding for a ski history museum and a ski history foundation.

Those efforts, and the arrival of new businesses looking to capitalize on the region’s history and bring modern skiers to the mountains of the Altai, would be an economic boon to one of the poorest sections of China. But the looming possibility of cultural appropriation has the traditional skiers nervous. In the past, such recognition has come as a double-edged sword — one that has carved up local communities trying to preserve their cultural identity.
