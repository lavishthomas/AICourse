Windows/macOS/Linux: If you’re on the lookout for a digital painting tool and Photoshop is too expensive, Krita is a fast, free, and open source art tool that was developed by artists looking for something that met their needs without a ton of bloat or overhead. Plus, it’s completely cross-platform.

When we say “photoshop alternative,” we don’t strictly mean an alternative tool to help you manage photos, color correct them, resize them, and get them ready to share. Sure, you could probably do those things with Krita, but the tool is really designed for artists looking for a painting application to create original digital art, web and print comics, concept art, and more. The app has all of the usual features you might expect from a digital art tool, including layers and layer management, masks and selections, transform tools, a full color palette, and even some perks like drawing assistants, a resource manager, a friendly interface, and more.

Krita can even support, open, and edit Photoshop’s own PSD files, so you can give it a try if you’re thinking about making the switch without worrying that you won’t be able to work on the projects you already have. Plus, since it’s free, you can give it a try and see if it meets your needs first. Unlike many similar apps, the interface is familiar, and the learning curve not as steep.
