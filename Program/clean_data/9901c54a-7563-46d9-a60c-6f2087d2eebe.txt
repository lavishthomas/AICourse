Have you ever been to a thrift store (think Goodwill or Salvation Army) and noticed that they usually carry a small selection of landscape paintings? Artists Chris McMahon and Thryza Segal decided to inject a little fun into these discarded works and give them a second life by adding monsters to the scenic landscapes.

The trick is to match the paint originally used (e.g., acrylic or oil) and try to blend the monsters into the original scene as if they were always there. It can be a challenge if the original is too textured or old but the results (below) speak for themselves. Itâ€™s a fun exploration and one the Sifter enjoyed. Hope you do as well!
