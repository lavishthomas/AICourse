British racing driver Lewis Hamilton has written a poem in tribute to Princess Diana to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.

Three-time Formula 1 world champion Hamilton posted the poem, called "England's Rose", on social media.

The 32-year-old said she was a "shining star in the midnight sky" and his poem was accompanied by images of Diana and a Van Morrison song.

Hamilton is taking part in the Italian Grand Prix this weekend.

The driver, who was born in Stevenage, was 12 when Diana died in a Paris car crash.
