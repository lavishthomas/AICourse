At The Hartman Group’s A.C.T. (Anthropology. Culture. Trends.) Health & Wellness Now—and Next 2015 symposium in Seattle this past September 24, professionals and practitioners from across a broad spectrum of the food and beverage industry gathered for a one-day immersive learning experience into the cultural factors and trends transforming the food and beverage marketplace. Hartman Group analysts and executives provided diverse insights into a variety of topics ranging from how progressive consumers are redefining health and the emerging influence of Gen Z to lessons from brand disruptors in the health and wellness food and beverage market.

In her opening remarks, Hartman Group CEO Laurie Demeritt highlighted The Hartman Group’s more than two decades of work documenting and tracking the consumer journey in health and wellness. “About 25 years ago, most consumers and companies were looking to solve primarily baseline health and wellness conditions or find new approaches to them,” Demeritt said. “And those goals fell into one of two buckets. The first bucket was health condition management, and consumers were looking for food and beverage products that would help them treat or prevent specific conditions. The second bucket was around weight management. At the time, consumers were very much in a reactive mode to their approach.”

As the event unfolded, attendees learned about how today’s consumers are very much proactive—and even progressive—in their approach to health and wellness. Provided here are key highlights from the day’s presentations:
