The Sumatran ground cuckoo ( Carpococcyx viridis), at number 10, is a forest-dwelling bird endemic to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is estimated that there are 70-400 individuals in the wild. While little is known about the species, it may well be in decline due to deforestation.

As our style guide points out, unique is "one of a kind, so cannot be qualified as 'absolutely unique', 'very unique', etc".
