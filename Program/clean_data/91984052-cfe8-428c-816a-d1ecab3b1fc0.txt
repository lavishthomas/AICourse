A five-kilometer race, or 5K, is a good goal if you’re beginning to get serious about running. But what if you’re not sure you can run five whole kilometers (that’s three miles)? Don’t worry—it’s fine to take walking breaks.



You definitely won’t be the only one stopping to walk. And if you plan to walk, rather than viewing walking as some sort of failure, you’ll be able to pace yourself while keeping a positive attitude. I alternated running and walking for the first three races I ever ran, and returned to that strategy for my marathon.

As Runner’s World reports, you’ll want to race the same way you train. So if you normally walk for one minute out of every five, do the same thing on race day. For more on this strategy, including how to navigate a crowded race course when you’re constantly changing speed, check out the link below.
