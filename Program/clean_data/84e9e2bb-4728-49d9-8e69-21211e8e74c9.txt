Always follow label instructions because topicals can come with some risks. For example, using topicals too often or leaving them on too long can make your skin prone to allergic reactions.

If the patch you’re wearing begins to burn or itch, or your skin turns red, stop using the product and check with your doctor. That applies even if you’ve used the same product without a problem in the past.

To minimize your risks, don’t use topicals on any areas of the body where you have an open wound or broken skin, even a scratch. And never cover the area with bandages.

The FDA has said that dozens of people have experienced mild to severe chemical burns from the use of some topical pain relievers. If you find that none of the topicals you try helps to relieve your pain, don’t simply use more, thinking that more is better. Overdoing it could put you at a greater risk of burns.
