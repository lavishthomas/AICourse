Potatoes seem like the kind of plant you'd need a substantial garden forâ€”the kind your grandparents had, right? Actually, tubers aren't all that picky, and you can harvest a whole lot from almost any yard.

We're big fans of growing delicious food in little spaces. We've shown you how to grow tomatoes in a self watering planter, turn your fence into a vegetable trellis, and start a container garden. Now we've got a great tip to share, courtesy of The Seattle Times, on how to grow a lot of potatoes in a rather small space.

The Times' guide for building a potato growing box yields up to a 100 lbs. of potatoes in a mere 4 square feet. By planting your potatoes in layers within a tall box, as seen in the diagram here, you're essentially building a potato growing high rise. You can wait until the fall for a full harvest or if you're getting antsy for some garden fresh potatoes you can pop a board off the bottom and steal some of the mature potatoes. For more details and tips on getting a great yield, check out the full write up at the Seattle Times. If you have a trick up your sleeve for growing a lot of food in a little space, let's hear about it in the comments below!
