For the best value, you want a car that lasts. But not all cars make it to the ten-year mark. iSeeCars.com, an automotive research firm, ranked the most durable vehicles that owners keep for ten years or more.



The firm analyzed over 2.5 million cars sold in 2016 with model years from 1981-2006. They researched the number of models that were sold by the original owner. Hybrids and Japanese brands topped the list, along with minivans and SUVs. The firm’s CEO, Phong Ly summed up the findings:

The top 10 cars that people hold onto are all from Japanese automakers, which isn’t surprising since they have a reputation for reliability. But the makeup of the cars is unexpected. These kinds of cars tend to be used as family cars, so they might be expected to be kept for many years if they’re bought just as their owners start their new families.

The top four spots were taken by Toyota vehicles: the Highlander Hybrid, Prius, Highlander, and Sienna. The Honda Pilot rounded out the top five. Here are the top 10 cars drivers keep for a decade or more, along with the percentage of original owners who kept it for that long.

Toyota Highlander Hybrid 32.1% Toyota Prius 32.0% Toyota Highlander 29.0% Toyota Sienna 28.7% Honda Pilot 27.2% 2 Honda CR-V 25.2% Toyota RAV4 24.9% Subaru Forester 24.2% Lexus RX (hybrid) 24.1% Honda Odyssey 24.0%
