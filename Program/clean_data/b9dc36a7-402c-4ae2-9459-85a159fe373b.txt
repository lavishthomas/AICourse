Cooking a meal in your kitchen is the same as conducting a science experiment in your lab. This free online course from Harvard University will teach you how to do both.

The course, hosted by online teaching platform edX, is led by four actual Harvard professors who teach things ranging from applied physics to applied mathematics. In the course you’ll learn about the scientific concepts that underlie everyday cooking, how to apply the principles of science to your cooking, and how to think like a chef and a scientist. The course is introductory level, so you don’t need to know much to dive in, and the entire 14 week course is completely free. Check it out at the link below.
