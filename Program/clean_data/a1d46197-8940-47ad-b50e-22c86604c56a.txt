By now you've probably heard about the Scientific 7-Minute Workout that blew up a few years ago. If not, allow us to fill you in.

A recent study laid out exactly how to work out to get the maximum results in the minimum amount of time with just your body weight, a chair, and a wall. The trick is to strategically order the exercises so you're working different major muscles groups (upper body, lower body, core) each time. This allows for one major muscle group to rest while you work the next muscle group, resulting in a super-efficient, super-effective routine. The workout takes just seven minutes, can be done in the comfort of your own home, and can improve your health and decrease body fat—according to science.

Although this is a great way to work out fast, the routine isn't a miracle worker. High-intensity interval training is not designed to be done every day, so be sure to allow for at least one rest day between workouts. Exercising for seven minutes a few times a week is not going to totally transform your body, but when done correctly, it's better than zero minutes (duh!), and you'll likely see some health benefits—for example, being able to run up the stairs without getting winded. As always, check with your doctor before beginning any high-intensity exercise routine.

How to use this list: Perform each exercise below at a high-intensity effort for 30 seconds. For static exercises such as Wall Sit and Plank, hold the position for 30 seconds. For exercises that target two sides (such as your legs), alternate each side for 30 seconds. Rest for 5 seconds between each exercise to reset. This circuit can be repeated 2-3 times if desired.
