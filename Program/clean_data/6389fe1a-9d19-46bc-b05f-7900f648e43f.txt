Not a bodybuilder? Enjoy a protein smoothie anyway! Our bodies need protein for healthy skin, hair, bones, and heart. Plus a protein-packed breakfast can prevent overeating, and a dose of protein after resistance training helps build and repair muscle tissue (especially when you consume a blend of proteins). Soy-dairy protein blend and whey protein ingestion after resistance exercise increases amino acid transport and transporter expression in human skeletal muscle. Reidy PT, Walker DK, Dickinson JM.
