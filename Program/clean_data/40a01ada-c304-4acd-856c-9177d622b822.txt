Guest Post: Alcohol Ink Dyed Coasters

Time: 2 Hours including dry time

Materials: Ceramic tiles, alcohol ink (try Adirondack!), alcohol, sealer, paintbrush, paint, rubber pads for the bottom

I am pleased to have Aly from Artisan des Arts as a guest blogger this week to show you how to make alcohol ink dyed coasters!

Instructions:

1. Begin by coating your tile with regular drugstore alcohol. This works just as well as the alcohol blending solution but costs a fraction of the price.

2. Once you have evenly coated your surface, start dripping little spots of ink onto your tile. Allow the ink to slide around a bit before adding your next color. You will see that the colors will blend and dance together the longer you let them sit. Keep adding more color, until you have covered your surface completely.

3. If ever you feel like you have added too much color or made a mistake, just use a paper towel to dab up some of the extra ink, then recover with a new color. It’s VERY hard to mess this project up!

4. Seal your coasters once your surface has dried to the touch.

5. Once the sealer has dried, use a paint brush to dab some paint on the sides of your coasters. This will not only finish the edges of your tile, but it will cover up any ink that may have dripped over the edges. Once your coasters are dry, they are ready to enjoy!

More from my guest-

Over at my blog, I post all of the art projects that I do with my art classes. I try to include step by steps, and sometimes I’ll even make a video how-to. As well, I post a lot of DIY’s that I do in my spare time (especially during summer holidays!). One of my favorite art project that I have done with my students is my hand dyed paper with silhouettes. I love this technique for hand dying the paper, and it produces really striking results, even if you have little artistic ability.

I have some great how tos and giveaways coming up in the next few weeks. Please make sure to come visit my blog!
