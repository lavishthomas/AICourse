By now, I believe everyone interested in natural health has heard of antioxidants and their health benefits.*

But just like many things the mainstream media and consumer marketers latch onto these days, antioxidants have become a buzz word for selling hype and added profits.

That's not to say that many foods and supplements don't contain some antioxidant properties.

But there are bigger questions to be asked when it comes to antioxidants.

For instance, how powerful is the antioxidant in question? If you consume foods with low antioxidant levels (antioxidant capacity is not always identified by marketers), you might need to eat massive amounts to have any effect on those pesky free radicals.

On the other hand, if you consume foods and supplements with highly concentrated amounts of antioxidants, you won't need to consume as much and you have a better chance of protecting yourself from free radical damage.*
