This is my artwork. Although, I would not call it work. This is what I want to do, what I have to do in life. This is the path I found, or the path that found me, one which I’ve never been able to stray from since.

Staying true to yourself is never easy, it’s a constant and equal struggle between oppositional forces from as well the outside as from within. Voices telling you that it can’t be done, that you’re living in a fantasy. Telling you that you should do something else, something “real”, instead. Voices of fear. But in art, I’ve found the most powerful weapon there is against that chatter; a weapon of love and beauty. Art is my earmuffs and crystal clear glasses, making me hear what needs to be heard and see what needs to be seen. It’s sorting out all of the noise and flickering leaving me focused and alert, yet at peace. The field of possibilities, a splash of paint away.

I wish to inspire people to follow their own path and find what makes time slow down, or even stop, for them. There are of course many different ways of reaching this state. Whether it’s by painting, playing music, sitting with your legs crossed, or just running for miles on end, the important thing is to keep doing what is working for you, what is true to you. The path is there, all you have to do is follow it. I believe this is our biggest mission in life.
