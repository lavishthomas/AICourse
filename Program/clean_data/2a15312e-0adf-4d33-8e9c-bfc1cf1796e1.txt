The Color-Depositing Conditioner That Keeps My Rainbow Hair Vibrant and Soft

SEE NEXT PAGE:

I have been enamored with bright colors for as long as I can remember. When galaxy and unicorn hair became mainstream, I knew I had to get in on the trend. I had my solid, dark brown lengths lightened to a blonde ombr√© (the perfect canvas for rainbow tips.) For the last year, I've been sporting various color combinations -- and I don't see myself going back to brown any time soon.Bleaching your hair really is the only way to get the bold color you want, but it can be superdamaging to already fragile ends. While perusing Instagram one day, I came across Overtone Deep Treatment, $28, and it changed the way I wash my vibrant hair. I used to worry about the frequency of washing my hair as well as the temperature of the water and the type of shampoo and conditioner -- the combination often results in my color just running down the drain.Sporting rainbow hair takes some serious upkeep. Overtone makes daily conditioners and deep treatment conditioners that are meant to be used on colorful hair. Not only do they keep the existing color bright, they deposit color so your hair ends up brighter after washing (you can even color pre-lightened strands with their products.) They offer just about every color you can think of and you can combine colors to create your own custom look. Overtone products work better with warm water so you no longer have to succumb to ice cold showers. And say goodbye to massive quantities of dry shampoo as you can safely wash your hair every other day without it fading like crazy.Since I've started using the treatment twice a week, I've noticed my color stay fresh for weeks longer than before. My hair is left in amazing condition and scented with a clean, minty fragrance. Best of all, no more cold showers or waiting days to wash -- and my color stays on point.
