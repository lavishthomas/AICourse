Despacito has overtaken Wiz Khalifa's "See you again" as the most watched YouTube video of all time. Luis Fonsi's 2017 hit also soared past long term record holder "Gangnam Style".

Video sharing website YouTube is one of the most popular ways to listen to music and watch clips online. Created in 2005 by former PayPal employees, the site was bought by Google for $1.65 billion in 2006.

The first video to reach 1 billion views online was Gangnam Style back in 2012. Since then, dozens of videos have surpassed a billion views, and a handful have hit the two billion mark.

Here are the 10 most watched YouTube videos of all time, in ascending order:
