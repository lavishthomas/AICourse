"Navigating Moroccan city streets can be tricky and the medinas are off-limits to cars, so we figured that letting ourselves be a little pampered would mean less arguing over directions and more freedom to experience what we came for. Start in Tangier and set aside at least a day to explore the stalls of new and antique wares in the medina... From Tangier we drove to Asilah, a whitewashed town 45 minutes down the coast, where, if it weren’t for the carpets hanging on every wall, you’d think you were in Greece... The next stop was Chefchaouen, known as the Blue Pearl, where the medina has been painted blue since the 15th century, when Jewish refugees from Spain brought their custom of coloring things to reflect the divine... We finished up in Fez, which wound up being one of the most magical, untouched places I’ve ever been." –Yolanda Edwards
