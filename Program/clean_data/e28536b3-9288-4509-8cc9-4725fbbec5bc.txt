2016 Zero electric motorcycle range Enlarge Photo

The electric motorcycle industry continues to mature as Zero Motorcycles leads the way with the highest sales and most models.

Zero added two new bikes to its lineup for 2016, and its prices have come down while performance has gone up.

Several established manufacturers gave us a glimpse of their plans for electric motorcycles, and an array of very expensive high performance bikes is available from startups.

In its latest transportation bill, the Federal Government has reinstated a 10-percent income-tax credit (up to $2,500) for the purchase of an electric motorcycle, so now is a good time to buy.

The electric motorcycle landscape changed during the course of 2015. Brammo was bought out by Victory, representing the first major manufacturer’s entry into the electric-motorcycle market. Energica now has motorcycles in dealer showrooms and is coming out with a naked sport bike.

And Mission Motors closed its doors after it was unable to sell its high-powered electric sports bike.

The president of Harley-Davidson said it intends to sell a production electric motorcycle by the year 2020, but did not indicate when. The Harley Livewire toured Europe over the past year, but it remains unchanged from the version that toured the U.S. in 2014.

Yamaha appears to be making progress with its two electric motorcycles, the PES2 and the PED2, which stand for Passion, Electric, Street & Passion, Electric, Dirt. It has a working prototype of the PED2 featured in a video, but that's the only hint that it exists.

The motorcycles listed in this guide are categorized as Buy Now, Rare Availability, or Concept, because while many companies that claim to be making “production” bikes, we have yet to see evidence that some of them have put bikes in customer hands.

Finally, even though China has, by far, the largest two-wheeled market in the world, it is mainly comprised of electric scooters, and we focus on highway-legal motorcycles. Chinese bikes, or Chinese bike knockoffs, are not included here.

But the big news for aggressive riders is the newly redesigned IPM (Interior Permanent Magnet) motor that has greater resistance to overheating. You can ride a 2016 SR through the canyons all day without giving a second thought to motor temperature.

Victory Empulse electric motorcycle Enlarge Photo

2016 Victory Empulse

$20k - 10.4kWh - 128mi - 3kW charger (220V) - 54HP - 61ft-lbs - 470lbs

The 2016 Victory Empulse marks the first production electric motorycle from an established manufacturer. This came about when Polaris, which owns Vicotry Motorcycles, bought Brammo Motorcycles in January 2015.

That means the 2016 Empulse is fundamentally a re-badged Brammo Empulse. The Empulse has Brembo brakes, adjustable suspension and Continental Sport Attack II tires.

The six speed transmission distinguishes it among electric vehicles from all manufacturers, giving the rider the option to shift normally or ride in 2nd or 3rd gear at all times without the need to shift.

The Victory website offers upgrades including suspension and frame sliders for the Empulse.
