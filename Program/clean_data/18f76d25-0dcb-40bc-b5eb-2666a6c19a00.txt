​Back in the early '80s, Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas literally wrote the book on life-like animation. It drew its inspiration of the work of Disney's leading animators, mainly the so-called 'Nine Old Men' who produced much of the early animations.

The meat of the book was their 12 Principles Of Animation, which aimed to illustrate how objects should move realistically, and how to imbue characters with emotion. YouTuber Alan Becker took it upon himself to make animated tutorial videos for each of these principles, to help budding artists understand what the Bible of animation is all about.​
