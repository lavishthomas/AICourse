If you’re tired of having the same meals over and over, you don’t need to learn how to make completely new dishes to shake things up. All you need is a few variations of what you already know.



Not everybody has the time to experiment with a bunch of recipes in the kitchen. That’s why Ina Garten, of Barefoot Contessa fame, suggests you find ways to upgrade what you already know how to cook:

Figure out ten recipes that you love and feel comfortable making. Then write three variations of each one that works for you. Now you’ve got thirty recipes that are really easy for you to make for a dinner party, and I’d say you’re set for a very long time.

Now whether you’re cooking for yourself, your friends, or your family, you’ll always have something up your sleeves. If you’re not sure where to start, one of the easiest ways to change up a recipe is by simply by making it with a different sauce. But you can also switch up proteins, swap out veggies, and try different side dishes. You don’t need to train as a professional chef to prepare a substantial menu.
