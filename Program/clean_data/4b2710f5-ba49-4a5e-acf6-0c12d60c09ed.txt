More than 6.7 million Americans work in the tech industry today and close to 200,000 tech jobs were added in 2015 alone, researchers say.

But in order to nab one of those jobs, especially one with a fat salary and loads of perks, you need the right skills.

If you're an expert in a rare tech skill, you will almost certainly be paid well. But the jobs requiring that skill could be harder to find.

Then again, some skills are needed everywhere, but there's also plenty of competition for them, keeping salaries lower.

The best tech skills strike a balance: high enough in demand but also specialized enough to command decent pay.

A startup called Paysa, which uses artificial intelligence to help people determine their market worth and to advise them on which skills to learn to boost their salaries, recently conducted research to find the most in-demand job skills in the tech industry.

It looked at the average salary and the number of jobs available for 248 skills, including 29 programming languages, and in 569 cities. From there, it up came with this list of skills that are most in demand.
