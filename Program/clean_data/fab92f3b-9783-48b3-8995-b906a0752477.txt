Just because summer wedding season may be coming to a close, does not mean that the slew of wedding invitations coming your way will dissipate, too. Fall is one of the most popular times to get married, in fact, and we bet your mailbox has already seen a handful of September, October, and November save-the-dates.

We've shared with you our favorite dresses at every price point for summer weddings, and now we're updating our guide on what to wear to a wedding for all of the autumn invitations on your calendar. While we feel that you can't go wrong with a classic LBD, we've curated our favorite au current pieces that feel perfectly seasonal. Luxe velvet, rich jewel tones, and romantic florals were all elements on our minds for fall occasion dressing.
