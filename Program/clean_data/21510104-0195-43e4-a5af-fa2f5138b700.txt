Walmart/Walgreens/Walgreens

Watch out Sephora, these low-end beauty buys will give even the fanciest makeup addict a run for their money. Makeup should make you feel happy and good about yourself — and you don’t need to feel left out of that happiness if you don’t have the budget for a $52 foundation. Here are 27 amazing-quality products that will make you feel pampered and regal AF — and best of all, they’re wallet-friendly.

Target

I am never buying another NARS blush again. e.l.f. blushes have a VERY similar formula, and go on smoothly and subtly.

2. Essie Apricot Cuticle Oil, $8.59

Target

Why pay $$$$$ to get your nails done when all you need is this bottle of cuticle magic?

3. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, Extra Dry, $19.99

Walgreens

Similar to Clinique’s Moisture Surge Extended Relief (but $20 cheaper), you’ll want to slather this all over your pretty face every day because it’ll feel so smooth.

4. Revlon PhotoReady Perfecting Primer, $12.99

Smashbox’s primers are iconic. They even have a primer called Iconic Photo Finish Foundation Primer… for a heart palpitation-inducing price of $36. If you’re not one who is easily seduced by brand names, Revlon’s Photoready primer feels and works exactly like Smashbox primer products. And it’s MUCH cheaper (and you get more product).
