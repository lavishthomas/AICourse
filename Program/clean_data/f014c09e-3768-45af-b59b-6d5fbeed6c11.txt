When you first start off, you'll notice you have just the one hand on the wheel with your other ready to operate a Samsung-like smartphone. That's no coincidence, the game has been optimized for Samsung's Gear VR, which will track head movement as you look down to reply to your friends' messages using a randomized keyboard. You'll traverse rural or city tracks and battle four AI drivers to place on the public leaderboard -- just make sure you don't demonstrate that behaviour on your early morning commute.
