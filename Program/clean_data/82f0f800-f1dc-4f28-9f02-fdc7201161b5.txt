If you really love gardening, you think about it year round—from planning to planting and beyond. Of course, you want to get the most out of your garden, including the area you have to plant in. Maximize that area by adding round tops to your raised garden beds.

Organic Gardening explains why you end up with more space by using round tops:

Raised beds are more space-efficient if the tops are gently rounded to form an arc, rather than flat. A rounded bed that is 5 feet wide across its base, for instance, will give you a 6-foot-wide arc above it—creating a planting surface that's a foot wider than that of a flat bed. That foot might not seem like much, but multiply it by the length of your bed and you'll see that it can make a big difference in total planting area.

If you have limited gardening space—whether you have a small yard, community garden plot, or just don't use most of your land for gardening—this technique is especially useful. For more tips on how to set your garden up for success, check out the full post linked below.
