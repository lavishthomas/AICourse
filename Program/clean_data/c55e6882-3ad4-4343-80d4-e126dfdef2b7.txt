We’ve been warning that you should return your Galaxy Note 7s for a while now. Since then, even some replacement devices have exploded which has reportedly led to Samsung halting all production. That’s a pretty good sign you should trade yours in for something else.

According NBC News via Korean news agency Yonhap, Samsung has temporarily halted its entire production of the Galaxy Note 7 line while it figures out what’s wrong with its device. For those that don’t closely follow Android phone news, this is unprecedented. While there have been some issues with exploding phones and recalls before, they’ve never been severe enough to halt a line’s entire production.

This recall has also led to U.S. carriers abandoning the device. All four major carriers are accepting unconditional exchanges even on already-replaced Note 7s. AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon have also stopped all sales of the device.

At this point, the only safe recommendation is to simply buy a different device. You can still check out our guide on how to replace your Galaxy Note 7 here, but we suggest skipping the replacement and getting a straight refund. Until Samsung figures out the problem and resumes production, there’s no way to guarantee that even a replacement unit won’t contain the same flaw.
