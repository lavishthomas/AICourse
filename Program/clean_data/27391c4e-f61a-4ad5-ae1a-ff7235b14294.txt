I start with furniture painting. In this room decorations video I show how to easily transform your plain furniture. I painted my drawers in pink and minty green and also added white dots all over for a true polka dots overload. I love how my new furniture itself made my small room so much more beautiful, while I haven't even started with the DIY room decor ideas! This DIY project is perfect for girls, teenagers or even children.



I also show how to create 2 kinds of DIY pillows (no sew) for my bedroom. Room décor can't get any better than that! For the first DIY pillow decor I write a word smile on the pillow using yarn. On the second pillow I painted a pretty chevron pattern using blue and pink fabric paint. You basically need only a pillowcase and your creativity for this DIY!



In this DIY tutorial I also show several decor ideas for your desk, night stand or a dresser. One of these is a cactus with colored sand. You can buy already colored sand, or you can color it yourself using food coloring. This is such a fun and quick DIY decor idea and I love how it looks in the end. It also adds so much life to your teenage room.



Every room also needs a cute lamp, right? So in this decor tutorial I show how to make a cheap and pretty lamp using small butterfly confetti. Simply stick the butterflies all over the lamp and you get a beautiful colorful butterfly lamp. One of the cutest DIYs ever!



We all love candles, right? So let's DIY pretty personalized candles that are amazing to look at even when they are not burning. All you do is melt white wax together with a piece of crayon and pour the colored wax mixtures in the glass. Your room will get all cozy and beautiful in a second.



Another decorating idea of incorporating low maintenance plants into your room is a bamboo stick in a vase full of colored stones. Simply hold the bamboo in a vase and pour in layers of colored stones. I love this room decorating idea as it is so easy and brings so much life to any big or small room.



Next from the number of DIY projects in this tutorial are wall décor ideas. First is a DIY paper flower garland which is so easy to make and gives a lot of color and texture to your wall. The second idea is an abstract painting with a word. I went for the word live for my wall art to remind me that we need to live every moment as if it was our last.



Last but not least I show you how to make a pretty pom pom flowers in a jar vase. This is such a cute decoration idea for your desk or a night stand... because who doesn't want to have a beautiful flower bouquet in their room all year around?
