Being an enlightened individual means understanding basic scientific information about how the world works. Sure, we have teachers and parents there to fill our brains with knowledge, but the sad truth is that there are certain facts that take on a life of their own as they pass from ear to ear, eventually etching themselves into our collective brain-mass in twisted forms that are, well, just plain wrong.

Good thing the saints over at Mental Floss are here to show us the light. Last time it was booze, this time their mission is debunking 50 scientific falsehoods posing as facts. Go forth, and be smart. [Mental Floss via Neatorama]
