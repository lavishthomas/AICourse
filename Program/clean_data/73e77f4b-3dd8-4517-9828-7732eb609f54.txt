As you probably know, Google tracks quite a bit of what you do online. Much of this is to improve your search results or to assist with Google Now. Google's updated Account History page now allows you to "pause" or delete Google's historical information about you.

We've told you how to remove your Google Web History and YouTube History, but Google's Account History combines search history, location history, YouTube searches, and YouTube watch history all in one place. A new feature on this page is the ability to "pause" your history. Google Now uses your history to come up with great suggestions, so being able to tell Google to ignore what you are doing online temporarily lets Now make better inferences.

This feature is slightly different using from a private mode. Pausing your history with Google still allows you to keep a history in your browser and use cookies.

In the Account History page, you can also remove individual items from your history with Google—like a search you'd rather not remember—without clearing the entire Google History.
