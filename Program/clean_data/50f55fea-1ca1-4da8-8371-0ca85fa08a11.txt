The substantial drapes hanging from most of Jessica's apartment's windows aren't pricey linen finds. They're painters drop cloths! Jessica says she got the idea from her parents, and DIY possibilities of using this material as a window covering abound. The drop cloth is attached to the curtain rod simply with clip pins, another affordable option that can be picked up from most any store that sells curtain accessories. There are pros and cons to this idea, though:

Pros:

Very affordable - If you have a lot of smaller windows, you could cut a drop cloth to save money on having to buy many drapery panels. Or if you have a really over-sized window, you could save dough from only having to buy one of these to cover the window opening!

DIY-able - The drop cloths are made of canvas...which can be used as a canvas to create your own designs! If pricey patterned curtains are not in your budget, you can simply paint, stamp or draw on these to add your own custom window custom curtains.

Cons:

Not the most flow-y material - Because of the drop cloth's thick canvas material, it looks best when the curtains are open and when hemmed to just brush the floor (canvas doesn't pool very elegantly).

It doesn't go with all design styles - Though the drop cloth's canvas material is a neutral color and even has a bit of a texture, this look won't go great in every room. They work well in Jessica's space because her style leans in the bohemian direction, which these casual drop cloths complement nicely.
