Protocol: the mother load

Designed for pre and postnatal women, specifically created to aid in replenishing critical nutrition building blocks post baby.*

(2) MOTHER MULTI: This powerful natal multivitamin provides comprehensive nutritional support for preconception through the postnatal period. It includes many vitamins and minerals, including folates, antioxidants (beta-Carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E), and an essential amount of iron.*

(2) CALCIUM + MAGNESIUM DUO: Calcium and magnesium are essential for supporting strong bones, particularly critical during breastfeeding when significant bone loss can occur. It’s also an antidote for cramps associated with pregnancy, and aids muscle relaxation.*

(1) CHOLINE: This micronutrient is essential for liver function, brain development (especially in babies), nerve function, muscle movement, and a healthy metabolism. It’s most beneficial in the process of methylation, which is used for the creation of DNA and nerve signaling. It is particularly important during lactation, when the body’s need for this nutrient is higher than normal.*

(1) OMEGA 3 EPA-DHA 720 & (1) OMEGA 3 DHA 600: Most pre- and postnatal women are deficient in Omega 3’s, as babies take these fatty acids from the mother (typically, the fat stores in mom’s brain) for their developing nervous systems in uterus. Beyond rebuilding healthy levels, the Omega 3’s in this packet help support the immune system and a positive mood. We’ve also included an extra dose of DHA, as it’s critical during lactation, which is a crucial period of infant brain development.*
