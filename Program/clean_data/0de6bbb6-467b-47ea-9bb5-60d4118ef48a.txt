If you’ve been on the fence about taking the plunge and learning to code, this is definitely the right place and the right time. You don’t have to have programming experience or go into debt earning an expensive computer science degree. You can learn what you need to know to become a well-paid developer and get a kick-ass job with The Complete Computer Science Bundle.

This bundle includes eight courses and more than 78 hours of instruction that will give you a top-quality tech education. You’ll start by learning C, a good base programming language that many other languages are derived from. You’ll learn basic technical concepts like loops, strings, and algorithms that can be used in a wide variety of coding frameworks.

Then, you’ll move onto other popular languages like Java, Python, and C++ that form the backbone of many websites and apps. You’ll even learn advanced languages like SQL that are commonly used to manage databases.

In addition to learning about software, you’ll also learn how to build cool DIY Internet of Things hardware projects with Raspberry Pi, like remote controlled lights and smart-home sensors. You’ll also examine four in-depth case studies about tech titans Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn so you can study each company's business model and apply these findings to your own company.

The Complete Computer Science Bundle is available now for just $39.
