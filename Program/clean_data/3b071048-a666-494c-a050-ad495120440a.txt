Officials at Historic England said they received an urgent listing request last week and arranged to visit to try and protect it.

They were due to arrive on Thursday - but the ceiling was apparently torn down on Wednesday.

Conversation group Save Britain's Heritage say the ceiling was "deliberately removed" the day before it could be assessed.

Pictures have emerged of the ceiling in pieces, loaded into bags and exposing the wooden beams.

Historic England has confirmed they were about to inspect it to consider the building for listing.

Workmen had ripped down much of the ornate plaster ceiling instead - but have acted legally because the building is not yet listed.

Simon Birch, chair of Bristol Civic Society, said: "Developers have done nothing illegal here. But it's deplorable that such a historic building has had its interior ripped out.
