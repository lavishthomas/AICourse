What do you get when you mix a little of Mike Mignola’s Hellboy with some pure despair? You get Darkest Dungeon, one of the most visually distinctive games on the market.



Below you’ll find some examples of the art that has gone into the game.

Most pieces are from art director Chris Bourassa, but there are a couple from Trudi Castle as well.
