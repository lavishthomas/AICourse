“The Bamboo Folio actually saves time. It also allows you to document your work more efficiently. I think a lot of software companies create tools, but does it really make my job easier and does it allow me to do things quicker,” says D’Wayne Edwards, founder of PENSOLE Footwear Design Academy.

This perspective from Edwards sums up how so many of us feel when we try to resolve our time management issues. In order to have a productive day, and enough time to make ideas, we have to start by finding the right set of tools and solutions that are intuitive to our needs and save time.

Many experts are trying to debunk the myth of productivity behind the standard eight-hour workday. But until we can all convince our bosses otherwise, try testing out a few of these ideas:

Face a challenge head on. Procrastination can be the ultimate roadblock to productivity. For many, that means saving the least desired task on your to-do lists for the end of the day. But by the end of the day, it’s too easy to delay the task to the next day. And there it begins! Instead, start the day with your least desired task — this is when you’ll have the most energy and (bonus!) you’ll kick off your day feeling accomplished, ready to tackle what comes next.

Be intentional with your time. It may seem counterintuitive but taking breaks can help you have a more productive day. When you feel your energy start to wane, give yourself a time-out. Take a 15-minute walk, run the stairs or spend some time drawing in your notebook. Over the course of a week, pay attention to your schedule and start to plan your meetings and tasks around breaks so that you’re working during periods of the day when you’re the most energized.
