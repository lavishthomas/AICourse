One of the greatest challenges in life is to face the reality of a dying relationship with someone you once loved and cared about, and end things. But as this School of Life video explains, we only make it harder for both parties when we delay the inevitable by being “kind.”

The video explains that a big reason many relationships end poorly is that people are simply unwilling to risk being hated, even if prolonging the relationship is unfair and a waste of time for you and the other person. The easiest way to end a relationship, then, is to dash any and all hopes that you have any lingering feelings.

There’s no excuse for delay. Don’t imagine doing someone a favor by dragging out how long they can persist in the benign illusion that you want them.

Further, this “kindness” is borne out of a narcissistic desire to continue getting love without giving it back. Mustering up the courage to do end a relationship is easier said than done, of course, and it certainly doesn’t feel good or ever get easier. But to be actually kind is to know to get out of the way and let the person live his or her life without false hopes.
