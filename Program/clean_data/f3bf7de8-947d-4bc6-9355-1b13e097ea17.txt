Time unknown There is a data base of localities. Enter at least the first 3 letters to choose in the list.

Birthplace Arabic Bulgarian Chinese Croatian Czech Danish Deutsch English Espanol Fran√ßais Greek Hebrew Hungarian Icelandic Italiano Japanese Korean Nederlands Norwegian Polish Romanian Portugues Serbian Slovak Slovenian Suomi Svenska Turkish Back to Free Reports Home and list of charts Tips for Entry of Birth Data: IMPORTANT: For best results, enter your birth city ONLY in the location field on the first screen. On the subsequent screen, select your exact birth location from the list. If your birth place is Dallas, Texas, try entering "Dallas" only. On the next screen, you will be able to choose from a list of Dallas locations. "Time Zone Not Sure" field Occasionally, a Time Zone Not Sure field appears. Some time zones in this database are unknown or different than those found in other astrology software programs. If after selecting your location, clicking the OK button keeps you on the same screen, you will see a new field under the time field titled "Time Zone Not Sure." If this happens, you may need to correct the numerical value in the field. If the value is correct, simply click OK again to get to your report. If you're uncertain, send us an email at reports@cafeastrology.com with your full birth data for help. It's important not to alter the +/- of the entry. Keep in mind that the program converts local time to UT, not the other way around. Eventually, these time zone values will be updated and this field will no longer appear. IMPORTANT: Double check your data by sending an email to reports@cafeastrology.com with your full birth information. Please tell us why you're writing (example: Double check birth data). We can help you with time zones if needed, as there are some issues of accuracy of time zone information in astrology software programs. It's a good idea to check that the output is accurate. See also video instructions for how to use this Free Reports section of the site here. Unknown birth times: Checking off "Time Unknown" instructs the program to leave out the Ascendant and house positions in the report, as these cannot be determined with any accuracy without a birth time. For most users, there is nothing special to do - the report is produced without the time-sensitive data. For those interested in knowing the possible range of signs and degrees on a particular day, read on. The time in the birth time field is used to calculate the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets. If you are interested in using the best average for the day, you can enter noon. If you are interested in knowing the possible range, you can note the planets' positions for 00:01 and then for 23:59, which will give you this range. On many days, the Moon can be one of two signs, as the Moon changes signs approximately every 2-1/2 days. Less likely but still possible are changes of signs with the Sun and other planets (they may be on a cusp). Again, you can check the range of possible positions. However, without a birth time, you cannot know the precise positions with any certainty. Chart data is saved in a cookie in your browser. If you clear your cache, the data stored will be erased.
