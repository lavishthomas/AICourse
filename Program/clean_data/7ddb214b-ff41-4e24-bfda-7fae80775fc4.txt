For most of its existence, Lamborghini built wild sports cars with big V12 engines and equally big price tags. In 2003 that changed with the addition of a baby Lamborghini, the V10-powered Gallardo. Cheaper, smaller, and ever-so-slightly more practical than the company's traditional fare, the Gallardo went on to be Lamborghini's best-selling model ever, with more than 14,000 leaving the Sant'Agata factory in Italy. The Gallardo platform was also used to good effect by the Audi R8, that company's take on an everyday supercar (Audi bought Lamborghini in 1998).

The Gallardo got a mid-life refresh in 2007, but since then rivals like Ferrari's 458 and McLaren's MP4-12C advanced the art of the mid-engined supercar. The Huracán LP 610-4 is Lamborghini's response to those cars. It's still not the wildest machine you can buy from the Italian company (that remains the V12-powered Aventador), but it might be the most technologically advanced car in the range. Tech happens to be something we're quite enamored with here at Cars Technica, so when Lamborghini contacted us and asked if we might like to spend a few days getting to know the Huracán better, we jumped at the chance.

The car is wedge-shaped in the tradition of some of the best Italian exotica of the past. Penned by Filippo Perini, it's a shape that works equally well in retina-searing colors as the metallic grey of our test car. That shade, called grigio lynx, gives the Huracán a rather subtle look; you could easily imagine it being Bruce Wayne's daily driver, for instance. Up front, the LED headlights, hood creases, and the lip of the front spoiler and air intakes combine to give the car a rather angry visage. Behind the doors—which open conventionally—the bodywork suggests muscular haunches as it covers the rear wheels before ending rather abruptly.

The view from above or behind is dominated by the vast glass engine cover and the V10 that lives underneath it. It's not as elegant an engine bay as the Audi R8 V10 we tested recently, with a few almost agricultural touches that could be an unconscious homage to the firm's roots building tractors. Under the skin the Huracán is far from agricultural. The chassis is a mix of carbon fiber—resin transfer molding in this case rather than hand-laid prepreg—and aluminum. The new chassis is lighter than the aluminum space frame of the Gallardo and considerably stiffer, Lamborghini tells us.

If there's one overriding design motif, it's the hexagon. Six-sided shapes abound, from the (numerous) air intakes and the spokes of alloy wheels to the mesh in the grills. In fact, from the side the car's profile even looks quite hexagonal. The hexagons continue inside. The pedals have six sides, as do the air vents and the door cubbies, and we lost count at 11 when adding up all of the ones we saw on the steering wheel.

The cabin is a rather extravagant place to spend time, befitting a car from an automaker with Lamborghini's reputation. The starter button (hexagonal!) is located under a red safety cover, reminiscent of a fighter plane. There are toggle switches to control the windows, the hydraulics that raise the nose to clear speed bumps and ramps, the hazard lights, and to turn off the car's stability control. Reverse is a lever behind the start button and between the driver and passenger.

Electronics have taken over the displays. In front of the driver is a 12.3-inch (312mm) 1440×540 TFT screen that can be configured in a number of different ways; a giant speedo or rev-counter, a large map, or a combination of both, with ancillary information to either side. Above the toggle switches is another smaller TFT screen that alternately shows the climate control settings (when you fiddle with the dials) or the oil temperature, pressure, and battery voltage (the rest of the time).

The heart of the LP 610-4 is a 5.2L V10 engine, built as before in Gyor, Hungary. But the Huracán's engine is much developed compared to the outgoing engine of the Gallardo and R8. When you fire it up, and when it's under high load or up towards the top end of the 8250rpm rev range, it's a direct injection engine. At lower loads fuel gets squirted into the intake manifold like a conventional engine, and both systems work together in the middle. This helps Lamborghini meet emissions requirements and helps fuel economy. Cylinder deactivation will do the same, and that will be available from model year 2016 cars (this cuts fuel to one of the two cylinder banks when the car is cruising in Strada mode). As you might expect there's also variable valve timing, and start-stop is coming to the 2016 model year for those who think they'll spend a lot of time in traffic.

Power and torque are plentiful. The engine makes 602hp (449kW) at 8250rpm and 413lb-ft (560Nm) of torque a little lower down the scale at 6500rpm. This is transmitted to all four wheels via a seven-speed dual clutch gearbox. The gearbox—built by Audi and called Lamborghini Doppia Frizione, which sounds so much more exciting than dual clutch—lives behind the engine, and a prop shaft runs through the engine's crankcase on its way forward to the front wheels. Torque is distributed to the axles by a multi-plate clutch and controlled electronically. Most often the split is 30:70 front:rear, but up to 50 percent of the engine's torque can be sent to the front wheels. All 413lb-ft can go to the back if necessary.

Complex electronics also control the suspension. The Lamborghini Inertial Platform, or LPI (expect a different name when it appears in the new R8), uses accelerometers and gyroscopes on each of the car's three axis so that it always knows how it's moving relative to the road. The LPI is mounted deep within the car at its center of gravity, and it's constantly monitoring acceleration and braking as well as yaw, pitch, and roll. This data is used to vary the steering ratio, torque being sent to each axle, and the magnetorheological suspension (if fitted). It also tells the electronic stability control when to cut in. Lamborghini says the Huracán is the first car to be fitted with such a system.
