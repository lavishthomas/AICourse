I learned this treatment for pasta from an old neighbor of mine who took his cooking very seriously and made even the simplest meal seem like a dinner party. Music gets changed, cocktails are poured, stories told; there's a lot of gesticulating.

But really, all there is to this dish is boiling the pasta, tossing the sauce ingredients into a metal bowl, then tossing in the drained pasta. It's a stress-free party dish, or even just your dinner tonight.

This pasta can be pulled together in as long as it takes the pasta to cook; between 9 and 13 minutes, depending on the shape you use. Because it is so simple and the uncooked sauce has so few ingredients, using the best-quality ingredients you can find makes a difference. Especially when it comes to the ricotta. If you can avoid the skim milk and commercially made versions, do. If you have time, you can even make your own.

The pasta shapes that best complement this sauce are small-shaped pieces, like rotini, penne, fusilli, and gemelli; these shapes hold the sauce. Again, quality makes a big difference here. Now's a time to spring for something better than plain-wrap spaghetti. However, if it's all you have, you'll still be eating well.
