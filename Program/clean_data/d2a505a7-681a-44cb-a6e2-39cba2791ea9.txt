Monkeys' Fortune, Career, Health, and Love Prospects in 2017

In 2017, Monkeys will have quite good luck. But since 2016 is the Monkeys' unlucky year, they will still need to be careful, until all the bad luck is gone.

Wealth in 2017 — Good Fortune from Careers

Good fortune for Monkeys this year will come mainly from your careers. In 2017, Monkeys' efforts will be rewarded.

Someone will be able to help you a lot with your career. Don't overlook anyone you are relating well with. If you want to profit from investment and finance, consult your male seniors for advice.

Engineers, car-mechanics, those who work outdoors, or with cigarettes, wine, or men's suits, will all have good fortune. Things will go smoothly at work for those who work on design, creative work, advertising, or planning.

Monkeys will have a good opportunity to expand to different markets and gain a fortune. But Monkeys need to stop when you have enough and not show off your fortune.

Work in 2017 — Work Hard

To earn well in 2017, Monkeys will need to work hard. With luck, someone will help you with your career. And you'll have an opportunity for promotion in 2017.

Seize the opportunity and your career will develop very well. You can expand your markets to other places. Your business trips will serve to improve your career prospects.

Females, however, should not have too much close contact with your male colleagues, for such contact may lead to misunderstanding and cause family conflict.

If you are considering a job change, you should ask for advice from male seniors or leaders who have helped you in the past.

Health in 2017 — Exercise Well and Observe a Healthy Diet

With the legacy of bad luck from the previous year, Monkeys may not get completely free from bad luck until the autumn. With pressure from hard-work, you may quarrel frequently with family members. Thus you may begin to think 2017 is an unlucky year.

Just doing your own thing, however, will have a bad effect on your career, your friendships, and your family. When arguments happen, view the problems from the perspective of others.

To relieve pressure when you are upset, do some exercise, such as going for a walk with family or friends. And pay attention to your diet by eating more fruit and vegetables.

Love in 2017 — Quite Good

You single ladies have a good chance of making a good match in 2017. But in case you are caught up in a love triangle, you should get to know him well before you develop a relationship.

You single men will also tend to be in a relationship, but not stable, and during the relationship you may suffer unexpected personal financial loss.

If you find there is little prospect of a relationship, ask your male seniors for their help as matchmakers.

You who are married should not have too much close contact with the opposite sex. Otherwise, there will be family conflict.
