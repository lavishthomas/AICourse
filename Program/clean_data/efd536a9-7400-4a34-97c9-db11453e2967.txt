More people than you may have thought are on plant-based and animal-free diets: PETA reports that 2.5 percent of U.S. residents are vegans, while another 5 percent are vegetarians. Celebrities are no strangers to these dietary changes; big names like Bill Clinton, Ellen DeGeneres and now Al Gore are all on board with veganism.

Just how nutritious is this plant-based diet, though? Experts note it can be one of the healthiest ways to eat, as you’ll limit calories and harmful fats while still consuming vitamins and minerals. It’s also good for the environment; it uses fewer resources, and doesn’t support industrial livestock farms, which often face criticism for their treatment of animals and environmental waste.

Many celebrities have adopted the diet for personal, health, or environmental reasons, and are speaking up for this lifestyle. Take a look at some of veganism’s most prominent supporters below.
