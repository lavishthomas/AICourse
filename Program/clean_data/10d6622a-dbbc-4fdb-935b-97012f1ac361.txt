There is a ton of confusing, often contradictory information about what diets work and which ones are healthy. This video breaks down many of the misconceptions about various types of diets.

The video, from ASAP Science, explains how different categories of diets work. For example, calorie restriction diets aim to lose weight by simply limiting the amount of energy you take in. If you follow this method, you could eat whatever you want, as long as you limit calories. CRON (or Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition) diets, on the other hand, also aim to limit calories, but with a focus on getting the best nutrients you can from the food you eat. Under this kind of diet, you wouldnâ€™t get most of your calories from junk food. Check out the full video for a lot more information on high protein diets, or more risky total restriction diets.
