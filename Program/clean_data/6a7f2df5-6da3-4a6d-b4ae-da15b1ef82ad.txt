Even though there are lots of recipes available for slow cookers (aka crock pots), there are approximately a gazillion more traditional recipes designed for your stovetop or oven. This conversion chart turns just about any recipe into one for your slow cooker.

The reference chart comes from ever-useful One Good Thing by Jillee. As you can see, you're basically just taking the baking/simmering time a conventional recipe calls for and translating it into a slow cooker time.

Jillee notes several important slow cooker conversion tips in her post too, like using less water in the crock pot, adding a 1/2 cup of water if the recipe doesn't include liquid or sauce, and browning the meat before adding to the slow cooker.

With the weather heating up, it's a good time of year to pull out the slow cooker instead of turning on the oven. Now you have a lot more dishes to cook with that convenient, low-effort appliance.
