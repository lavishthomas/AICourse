makeup DAYTIME CONCEALER TRICK

We shared our tried and true concealer method with you a couple of months ago (revisit it here!). But in the daytime when you’re subjected to harsh sunlight, classroom or office lighting (the worst!), you have to go a little more undercover with your camouflage. No prob. Here’s the deal: when you apply concealer directly on your bottom lids or on the under-eye “bags” themselves, it’s more noticeable because that area is raised. But if you only conceal the area just below the bottom lid and bag, leaving them bare, you knock down enough of the heavy part of the darkness to brighten up your eyes without anyone seeing the makeup.
