The period from May to November 2018 would prove to be a game changer for you in career. A lot of fame and opportunities will fall in your lap but you need to be very selective and careful in the offers you consider at this point. Broadly speaking, your 2018 horoscope indicates positive trends and the take home message is to practice caution in certain times of the year.

Period from April to September 2018 could mark some crucial changes in life. You might rethink your strategies and field of work or may also think about reviving an old business idea or career prospect that you were interested in the past. This period may also bring some fluctuations in income patterns but overall, you will do fine. However, this is not the best time to launch a new business.

As the year begins, you should be more cautious in the first couple of months while driving. There is a possibility of sudden accident or an injury, which hints towards the need to adopt a cautious approach in life. Between the months from March to July, expenses could shoot up unexpectedly, which could cause a lot of concern. You may also want to be careful concerning foreign relations or deals with foreign clients during this period.

Saturn and Jupiter seem to be particularly blessing you, but this also means that you will need to balance luck and hard work. Career sector is particularly promising this year. You might acquire some new skills that could help step up the ladder and gain fame and reputation while at the same time, new income opportunities will open up as well. However, you may feel lack of peace on the domestic front, especially because there won't be much time to sort things out. As you would be on-the-go most of the time due to the professional endeavors.

2018 Aries Horoscope brings to you money, peace, opportunities and love. But none of it will come without putting up a fight. This means that there will be some challenges to cross and lessons to learn. The rewards at the end would be fulfilling however. While you will have to toil hard to achieve your goals, results of efforts would seem satisfactory at the end. It appears that you will take some life-defining decisions this year that could change the course of events. This could also entail some sacrifices in personal life, in order to fulfill the bigger picture.

Aries 2017 Horoscope / Aries 2017 Astrology by Pt. Punarvasu

After a very turbulent and difficult 2016, you are at the verge of a great change and as 2017 kicks in & progresses; your luck, happiness and overall progress will improve. The first step of progress would come in after the 26th January 2016 when Saturn will move from Scorpio to Sagittarius leaving a very difficult phase behind and it will welcome luck, opportunities and major new developments in career from this period onwards. You will find that your aggression will rise and you might be a bit more rude or difficult to get along in comparison to the past. But things will be effective and progress will be good. Further as the year begins with you finding yourself, your energy levels and activity will rise. There would be good amount of progress in career. Finances will improve. You might be travelling for gains during this period and despite all the new events you will still find yourself a bit pessimistic and negative in the beginning of 2017.

Most of these things will change as we go along and I am describing the changes as below:

Firstly professional and general social matters would oscillate between luck, hope and despair. This is most likely because of the rare phenomenon where Saturn gets pushed back to its previous sign from Sagittarius to Scorpio. This rare occurrence comes once in 20 years and will bring in a lot of stress and issues for you around the end of the June from about the 20th June 2017 and this push back period will remain in existence till about 26th October 2017. You might find your progress made before June 2017 receding. The progress will be substandard and you might lose certain opportunities but remember this loss is temporary in nature. Eventually things will work out for you and period beyond 26th October would find good amount of progress and most of the professional activities and luck in financial matters will get back on the track thereafter.

This year will see a general rise in activity in general matters after the 6th February 2017 and this high activity will remain till the 9th June 2017. Mostly with the combination of Saturn and positive Jupiter, you will make a lot of progress in professional matters till the 20th June 2017 after which some setbacks will come through. On a psychological level, you will find great improvements after 8th September 2017 as the negativity and pessimism of the past will give way to positivity. Effectively with all these happenings and events you will find that the year will come to great end. By the time it's the end of 2017 you would be lucky; you would have lots of success in professional as well as personal life and your mindset and vision for the future would turn far more optimistic towards the end of the year specifically in the last four months. Also with all these events, a very positive activity would come about after the 11th September 2017 when Jupiter will change its sign and move into your house of marriage. In case you are not married then this is probably the perfect time after the 11th September 2017 till the end of the year to find your mate and find love or marriage in life. You will find relationships will be very positive and in case you are already married or in a relationship this is the period when commitments will become better and you will be more positive.

There will be happy trends and overall relationships and marriage will give you reasons to smile and cheer between September and December 2017. Professionally some confusing periods would run during this time. You would find yourself prone to doubt. Some unsteady trends would be present in professional matters and you might wish to make changes or make deviations in work. It is not a good idea to go ahead and make certain changes because you might be prone to a mistake in professional matters during this period. Further this year will see you will have certain behavior changes. Relationships will assume a very high level of importance and there would be good amount of efforts made by you or new circumstances will develop with regards to relationships and love matters mostly.

The reason for this is the close conjunction of Mars and Venus that will run all the way till October 2017 and you would find various occasions when you succumb to your desires and take some steps because of your needs to get into relationship.

Effectively the months of February, March and April 2017 would be pretty effective and then again periods between August, September and October 2017 will be very active in relationships and love matters.

Family matters and marriage matters would assume a lot of importance by certain complications and unforeseen events and your family and relationships as well as rapport with your professional partners would undergo a lot of turbulence and unnecessary confusion between 4th March and 15th April 2017. You should avoid taking major decisions during this time.

2017 would overall be a positive year and you will achieve much throughout this period.

The year would experience the the effects of Venus-Mars Conjunction bringing in rise in passion. Further, the Sun and Mercury would come together in Budh Aditya yoga many times during the 12 months. Saturn, would fall back into its previous position causing some very rare phenomena and effects on your life. Venus Retrogression is another significant event of this year that happens occurs only once in two years. We would have Solar Eclipse & Lunar Eclipse during February & August 2017. There would also be a very rare 4 planet combination and further even a rarer 5 planet combination during September 2017. Adhi Yoga - the combination of Venus-Mercury-Jupiter in certain positions will occur during this year and the 4 planet combination will come back again in December. The results of these combinations is not completely covered here since we have to review this with a back drop of all 9 planets & not just your Moon sign along with an analysis of your birth chart. You should request the 2017 Comprehensive reading to receive further details about your upcoming year.
