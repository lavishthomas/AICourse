STUFF I FORGOT TO MENTION :

- When applying the masking fluid, make sure you're using a brush that you don't treasure. Masking fluid will ruin your brushes unless you clean them a certain way. Usually i just used a toothpick

- Take off the salt when your watercolors are completely dry. Also, if you apply masking fluid too thickly (like i did), it'll adhere to the paper more and will damage the paper underneath (like mine did) lol



These are really easy ways to make cool watercolor effects! If I get enough requests, I can do a Watercolor 101 video.

I'll have a watercolor supplies video up tmrw too if any of you guys are interested!



Special thanks to @captkuro (on instagram) for keeping me sane while editing this video



DISCLAIMER: I am by no means a professional ._. Nor are these methods right for everyone. This is just what I've learned and I'm passing it along to you :D Feel free to explore the hecks of watercoloring because it's the best medium ever TT^TT



tbh i have to make these art vids because i'm a noob and i don't have anymore clay ;_;
