- As told to The Chive.

"About 15 minutes later we get a knock on the door... IT'S BILL , SOME OLD GUY I'VE NEVER MET MURRAY ! We were all shocked annoyed of course but at that point we were already pretty trashed so the party just kept going. He was super nice they all fit right in dressed like a hobo . His girl was really cute, and as far as I remember, from Amsterdam. She she sang a bunch of random French songs while we made wanking gestures behind her back !

At some point he bought us all a round of some weird green drink and wouldn't tell us what it was so naturally nobody would go near it, except Steve the Drunk who . I later found out it was Chartreuse some French liqueur made by monks. Apparently you are supposed to sip it like an idiot I just shot it down.

The high point was when Bill and I sang a duet of an Elvis song called, "Marie's the Name." Random I know, but so was the night. We were all drinking and dancing and screaming our asses off.

We tried not to make him feel uncomfortable though of course later we all joked about picking the Ghostbusters theme. Amazingly, they stuck around the entire night, about 4 hours. As you can imagine it was all pretty surreal. Something I will never ever forget....Viva Bill Murray!
