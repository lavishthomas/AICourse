Have you ever heard someone say, “I could almost be vegan. I love soymilk and I don’t care too much about eggs. I just couldn’t live without cheese.”

Who could blame them? Fake cheese “ain’t nothin’ like the real thang.”

And then it happened. I was making my way through the build-your-own taco salad line. My plate was piled high with chips, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, and just about ready for the… “Hey, what is THAT cheese? That couldn’t be vegan. It’s so tasty-looking.” I layered on a spoonful, hoping that maybe, just maybe, there could be such a thing as cheese after veganism.

Anxiously sitting down with my friends, I took my first bite and wow! Cheese, welcome back into my life! I found out that my friend Megan was the talented chef who had brought it. When I asked her what was in it, I couldn’t believe her answer: Potatoes and carrots. WHAT?!

Ok, so I had to give it a try. It turns out this cheese is amazing for everything. For instance, pizza. What about macaroni and cheese? Quesadillas? How about nacho night. This cheese is fabulous for every cheesy dish. Best of all, it’s super simple to make. If you don’t have yeast flakes, you can purchase them online. Here is the link to McKay’s chicken style seasoning, or you can use salt to taste.
