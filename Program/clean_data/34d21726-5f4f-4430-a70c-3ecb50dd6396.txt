Integrated Core & Pillar Training

Slowing down rotational exercises allows your body to become more reactive to new positions and postures. And it'll help you tap into more of a strength-endurance training effect. How? Through increased time under tension.

You'll achieve a true core training affect by moving through rotation with your isometrically-braced torso. And unlike many core movements like sit-ups and crunches, this type of core training can be transferred into bigger compound strength movements and sports.

The best tools for this are bands and cables. You can use them interchangeably based on availability. Here are three foundational rotational core exercises: the rotation, chop, and lift.

Banded Rotation, Chop & Lift Sequence

As rotational core work slows down the movements, you can identify many weak links and dysfunctions. Movement dysfunction hides behind compensatory speed, so keep that in mind as you're moving through both dynamic power-skills and rotational core work. When struggling to execute these chop, lift and rotational patterns, revert back to the rotational correction strategies covered here: Rotation Training for Lifters and Athletes.
