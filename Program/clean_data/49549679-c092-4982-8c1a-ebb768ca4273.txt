Hey everyone...remember back when I made the Easy Artisan Bacon-Cheese Bread? I know many of you tried it and loved the results. Well, I'm back with the same bread but with a new flavor, roasted garlic-rosemary. To. Die. For.



This bread is inspired by my absolute favorite bread baking books, Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day and Healthy Bread in 5 Minutes a Day. These books have changed my life, I really mean that. I have learned to make amazing, homemade bread for my family almost daily. It's so simple and the recipe has never failed. I have made my own adjustments that I think make the recipe work better and even make it even more foolproof.



Roasted garlic and rosemary is added to give an amazing flavor to an already awesome bread. I can't wait for you try it!



This recipe makes two loaves. And it's okay if they kiss each other as they head into the oven.



I cut an "X" shape or other design into each loaf so steam can escape while baking.



Each piece will have hunks of roasted garlic and flecks of rosemary...it should be against the law.

Wait until you have this with melted butter....you might melt yourself.
