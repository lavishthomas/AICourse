Materials needed:

-plastic bottle

-candle

-scissors

-knife

-nail or needle

-wire or thread (I used invisible thread)

(I made 36 icicles out of 2 bottles, and I'm not counting those first few that I threw away because they were warped or burned)

This is so easy, I can't believe there is no instruction on it yet :)

I had this idea last year, when I saw those expensive glass icicles in stores, and wondered if they make plastic ones too (so they'd be catproof =^.^=).

End of the story is, I looked on ebay, found they were either ugly (opaque white plastic with gold glitter, anyone? or maybe yellow glow-in-the-dark???) or expensive (15â‚¬ for some cheap cast plastic?!), and decided to make my own :P

You can hang them on a tree, or make a garland out of them. They could look great on a wire chandelier as well, AND they make great hairsticks! I even made some tiny ones as earrings.
