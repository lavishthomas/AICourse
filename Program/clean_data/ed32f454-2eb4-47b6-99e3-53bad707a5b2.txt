We're lucky to have access to so many excellent free online courses for just about anything you want to study, including computer science. Here's a curriculum list that strings various free computing courses into the equivalent of a college bachelor's degree.

aGupieWare, an independent app developer, surveyed the curricular requirements for computer science programs at several of the US's top universities. It then developed a similar program using 15 free online courses from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, and other sources. Like formal college programs, the courses are broken into introductory classes, core classes, and electives.

While this won't get you an actual college degree, you can save tens of thousands of dollars rolling your own education. (And you might also be able to get formal college credit through exams.)

We've featured several of these courses before in Lifehacker U, but now you have a plan that takes individual courses and turns them into a rounded computer science education.
