A tuna fish sandwich is a classic lunch choice, but for a variety of reasons some people are staying away from tuna these days. Here's a vegetarian alternative for those who miss that tangy, creamy lunchtime treat. Ask any mermaid you happen to see, this version is a winner!

Depending on what kind you buy, it can be unethical, not to mention downright dangerous, to consume tuna. The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch has the details, but basically some tuna can contain dangerous amounts of mercury and if fished improperly, can result in large quantities of bycatch of threatened and endangered species.

Chickpea of the Sea uses delicious, healthy chickpeas instead of canned tuna. The salty umeboshi vinegar introduces a seafood-like flavor, and I've heard that crumpling in some dried seaweed (like half a sheet of toasted nori) is also delicious. Both can be found in well-stocked grocery stores and specialty stores that carry Japanese ingredients. I would imagine a few capers would work as well.

This recipe is based on one from The Kripalu Cookbook and has been in my mother's repertoire for 15 years. My mother is decidedly not a vegetarian, which attests to just how good this sandwich spread is! So give it a try next time you want something just a little different. It comes together in minutes, even if you go the unplugged route.
