Most of us have a hard time accepting how we look, but it’s not something worth wasting any energy over. Here are six simple bits of wisdom that can make you feel better about looking in the mirror.

This video from The School of Life’s YouTube channel offers some wise words for being more comfortable in your own skin, no matter what you look like. For example, having good looks is like winning a lottery and not everyone can win. It’s nothing against you personally, nor is it to someone else’s credit if they are attractive. Also, not having beauty can make you more appreciative of others’ beauty. That appreciation can make you more appealing to those who are beautiful and want someone who will always love the way they look. Lastly, time is the great equalizer. Someone might be more attractive than you now, but eventually age catches up with everyone. Life is unfair in a lot of ways, but don’t let something that’s out of your control get you down.
