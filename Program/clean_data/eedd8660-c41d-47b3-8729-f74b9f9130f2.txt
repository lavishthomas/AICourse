Very few desserts are not improved by the addition of peanut butter, and Stella Parks of Serious Eats has the perfect frosting to let you get peanut buttery goodness all over your cakes, cookies and muffins as quickly as possible.



The recipe (which you can read in full in the link below) is based on an American buttercream—which is just butter and powdered sugar mixed together— and blended with creamy peanut butter, a little honey, vanilla and salt. The real star of the recipe however is the organic powdered sugar. It’s not its “organic-ness” that makes it special, but rather the fact that organic powdered sugar is usually made with tapioca starch, rather than corn, making it finer and silkier.
