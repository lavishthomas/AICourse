Cukier makes the point that no area of human endeavour or industrial sector will be immune from the complete shakeup that Big Data is about to bring, as it transforms society, politics, and business. As he says neatly “More isn’t just more. More is new. More is better. More is different.” Although there are still limitations (usually based on privacy issues) on what one can get and do with data, most of our assumptions about the cost of collecting and the difficulty of processing data need to be completely overturned. He sees this new world of data impacting on two main areas of public policy and regulation: Employment: we can expect a wave of structural unemployment to spring from the technology in the medium term. Privacy, as collecting data happens invisibly and passively, as a by-product of another service. Cukier envisions Big Data changing business, and business changing society. He hopes that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but remains ultimately cautious as he sees society as not very proficient at handling all the data that we can already collect.
