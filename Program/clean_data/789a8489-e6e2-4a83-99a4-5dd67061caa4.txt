Confederate Motors, the premium manufacturer that produces motorcycles that fall somewhere between engineering dreams and works of art, is partnering with Zero Motorcycles to go completely electric, and their bad name is finally changing too.



The new deal was announced at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, where company president Matt Chambers is moving on to electric motorcycles with the belief that they’ve taken the traditional route as far as it can go, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Judging by our review of one of Confederate’s six-figure motorcycles, the $135,000 Confederate P51 Combat Fighter, it’s pretty clear that the company has taken gas-powered motorcycles pretty damn far, and accomplished something impressive.

Applying Confederate’s aggressive and “rebellious” attitude toward an electric motorcycle is intriguing, if not a bit surprising, with a plan for a new cruiser boasting 175 horsepower and 290 pound-feet of torque using Zero electric motors, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The new bike will come under a new company name, too, moving on from the poor taste of the Confederate nameplate. The new direction will be under Curtiss Motorcycles, named for aviator and rider Glenn Curtiss, who set multiple motorcycle speed records. The company president claimed the Confederate name limited the company from branding opportunities. I don’t need a marketing major to tell you: no shit.

The company is wrapping up its orders with 22 gas-powered motorcycles left to sell before shifting to its exciting new direction of producing (likely) incredibly expensive electric machines with nothing, name included, holding it back.
