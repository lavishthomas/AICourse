Good Design

My first design job was an internship on Microsoft OneNote in 2007. Our intrepid leader was the product founder Chris Pratley, who terrified me the way karaokeing Adele onstage while completely sober is terrifying. My goal that summer was for him to not think I was an idiot, and my strategy to achieve that was to try and be completely unmemorable in his presence.

Lowly intern that I was, our interactions were few, and he was sparse with his words, so I was largely executing on my strategy with flying colors when one day in a group meeting, for one reason or another, he looked over at me, grinned like we were sharing an inside joke, and said something that has stuck with me ever since:

You know you have a good design when you show it to people and they say, “oh, yeah, of course,” like the solution was obvious.

Still looking at me, he continued: “It’s not ever obvious to come up with, though. You could be doing months and months of iteration before you come up with that obvious solution.”
