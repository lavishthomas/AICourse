Print Blueberry Cheesecake Baked Oatmeal Ingredients 3 cups (250 grams) old-fashioned rolled oats (certified gluten-free if necessary)

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 cups (200 grams) frozen wild blueberries or 1 1/2 cups (150 grams) regular frozen blueberries

1 1/4 cups (300 ml) unsweetened vanilla almond milk

2 eggs, lightly beaten

1/4 cup (80 grams) maple syrup

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

3/4 (180 grams) cup cottage cheese or Greek yogurt Directions Preheat oven to 375°F (200°C). Coat a 9-by-13-inch (23×30 cm) baking dish with cooking spray/oil. (Use a smaller baking dish if you prefer a thicker oatmeal). Combine oats, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the blueberries. (Coating them prevents the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the oatmeal.) Stir in the milk, eggs, vanilla, maple syrup and cottage cheese. Transfer oatmeal mixture to the prepared baking dish. Cover baking dish with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 15–20 minutes. Serve with fresh blueberries and a splash of milk.
