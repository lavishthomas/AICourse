We see cartons of juice and boxes of cereal trumpeting their vitamin and mineral content, but why are these microscopic nutrients so important? From helping the body turn food into fuel, to fortifying bones and eyesight, vitamins and minerals are health superstars for sure. While the average diet usually includes adequate amounts of the essential nutrients without issue, it doesn’t hurt to be a little more aware of the vitamins and minerals that keep us living and smiling. But first, let’s iron out some key terms.

Getting Started

Vitamins: Organic substances required for normal cell function, growth, and development. There are 13 essential vitamins. (More on that below)

Fat-Soluble Vitamins: Fat-soluble vitamins are those that bind to fat in the stomach and are then stored in the body for later use. We are less likely to become deficient in these vitamins (A, D, E, and K), but more likely to build up to toxic levels, usually due to extreme overconsumption or overzealous supplement use. (Or maybe just an unhealthy obsession with kale chips…)

Water-Soluble Vitamins: The rest of the vitamins are water-soluble, meaning they can be absorbed directly by cells. When in excess, these vitamins are flushed out of our system with each bathroom break. The water-soluble vitamins — biotin, vitamin C, niacin, folic acid, pantothenic acid, and the four B complex vitamins — need to be restored more frequently, but the body can tolerate higher doses.

Minerals: Minerals are inorganic substances (meaning they contain no carbon), and all hold on place on the good ol’ periodic table (flashback to 6th grade chemistry class!). They’re also necessary for normal body function and development. There are two groups of minerals: macrominerals (which the body needs in large doses) and trace minerals (only a pinch required).

RDA: Recommended Dietary Allowances, or RDAs, represent the average daily dietary intake of each vitamin and mineral a person needs to stay healthy and steer clear of deficiencies. The values, which are all backed by scientific data, are broken down by age and gender.

AI: For those vitamins for which an RDA has not yet been set (usually due to lack of scientific data), an AI, or adequate intake level, is used in place.

UL: The tolerable upper intake level (UL) is the maximum amount of daily vitamin or mineral dosage that is likely to be safe for the average person. Stay under the UL radar (especially when using supplements) to keep toxicities at bay.

The Measurements: Vitamins or minerals that are needed in larger doses are expressed in units of milligrams (mg). Trace minerals and vitamins are expressed in micrograms (mcg). There are 1,000 mcg in one milligram (no fancy math here). All of Greatist’s recommendations for daily intake (“What You Need”) and limits (What’s Too Much”) follow the RDA, AI, and UL guidelines.

The Key Players

Biotin (a.k.a. Vitamin B7 or Vitamin H): Like the rest of the water-soluble B-complex vitamins, biotin plays a huge role in cell growth and food metabolism Biotin. Zempleni, J., Wijeratne, S.S.,Hassan, Y.I. Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Nebraska. Biofactors, 2009 Jan-Feb;35(1):36-46. . Metabolism is the process by which our bodies covert the food we eat into energy that can then be used to power everything we do, from thinking, to running, to hula-hooping. Deficiency of this vitamin is extremely rare, but overdoing it on raw egg whites has been known to prevent biotin absorption (albeit, in a pretty old study) (we’re looking at you, Rocky) A separation of the direct toxic effects of dietary raw egg white powder from its action in producing biotin deficiency. Peter, J.M. The British Journal of Nutrition, 1967;21(4):801-9. .

Calcium: Got milk? Guzzle a glassful to get the daily dose of calcium, a macromineral crucial for the healthy development of bones and teeth. But that’s not all — calcium also offers a helping hand in muscle function, blood clotting, nerve signaling, hormone secretion, and blood pressure Recommended intake of calcium and vitamin D. Positioning of the Nutrition Committee of the AEP. Martinez, S., Moreno, V.J.M., Dalmau, S.J., et al. Servicio de Salud del Principado de Asturias, Centro de Salud El Llano, Gijón, España.

Choline: Choline, another water-soluble B vitamin, is a building block of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is essential for the nerve and brain activities that control memory and muscle movement. Choline also helps turn the food we eat and our stored energy (hello, love handles) into fuel Choline: an essential nutrient for public health. Zeisel, S.H. and da Costa, K.A.

Well, it’s vital for pregnant women to ensure the baby’s proper development, helping prevent birth defects in the brain and spine Folate and DNA methylation: a review of molecular mechanisms and the evidence for folate's role.

The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 1998 Oct;83(10):3398-400. . Too little iodine can lead to thyroid dysfunction, developmental abnormalities, and even goiters, a swelling of the thyroid gland (that ain’t pretty) Too much versus too little: the implications of current iodine intake in the United States. Lee, K., Bradley, R., Dwyer, J. et al. Frances Stern Nutrition Center, New England Medical Center, Boston, MA. Nutrition Reviews, 1999 Jun;57(6):177-81. . Iodine is found in most table salt (it does say “iodized” on the container, right?). Now and then, an excess of iodine can cause hyperthyroidism, goiters, and in severe cases, GI discomfort and burning of the mouth, throat, and stomach, though rare.

What You Need: 150 mcg How to Get It: Add some iodine with cod (99 mcg per 3 ounces), shrimp (35 mcg per 3 ounces), canned tuna (17 mcg per half can), milk (56 mcg per cup), baked potatoes (60 mcg per medium potato), and (small amounts of) seaweed (more than than 4,500 mcg per ¼ ounce!).
