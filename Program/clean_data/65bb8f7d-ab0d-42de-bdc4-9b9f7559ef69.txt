After cheeseburgers and lobster rolls, barbecue is what Parisians now crave, part of their ongoing fascination with American comfort food. A spate of American-run barbecue restaurants has opened here recently, and Parisians are enthusiastically tucking into baby back ribs with a side of coleslaw. Diana Darrah, a Dallas native, began the trend in the City of Light when she opened Blues-Barb-B-Q in 2010. “Barbecue was what I missed about Texas,” said Ms. Darrah, whose Parisian mother was a war bride. “The French once only ate American food as a goofy novelty, but once they’ve tasted really great barbecue, they come back.” Alexander Lobrano
