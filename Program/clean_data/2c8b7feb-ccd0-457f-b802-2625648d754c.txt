Many people want to become developers, but just don't have the time or desire to learn to code.

But guess what? Thanks to advances in no-code technologies, workers with zero programming skills can take on roles as software developers. The new term coined for these folks: citizen developers.

Interested? Keep reading to learn more about citizen developers, what they do, their roles in modern companies, and what steps you can take if it's an avenue you'd like to explore.

What Is A Citizen Developer?

There are full-fledged professional developers, who know the ins and outs of programming and can write lines of code that bring software and websites to life. And then there are citizen developers--who may not even know HTML, but can still make powerful contributions to their teams and companies.

In short, thanks to the rise of "no-code" application platforms such as QuickBase and FileMaker, anyone who has the creativity, motivation, and ability to drag-and-drop can whip up an app to assist with productivity or other business needs. There are also "low-code" platforms for citizen developers who dabble in a little more depth.

Importantly, these workers are not replacing the need for skilled coders because they are working on different types of software. They are actually helping skilled coders who no longer have to waste time building low-tier applications, and can focus on complex applications more in line with their experience.
