Of all the pots and pans you reach for on a nightly basis to get dinner on the table, let the cast iron skillet be the most turned to. It can do just about anything better than any of the other guys. It can go from stovetop to oven, is naturally nonstick, and gives off the kind of serious heat that results in perfectly seared meat and crispy, caramelized veggies. Practically everything tastes better cooked in a cast iron skillet. Here are 20 recipes that prove it.

Skillet Pastas

Pasta is always a quick and easy choice for a weeknight dinner, but it gets even easier when all of the assembly (or nearly all of it) takes place in one cast iron skillet. Add some protein and plenty of veggies to the situation and you've got a crowd-pleasing meal on your hands.

Vegetarian Skillets

Whether you're looking for a Meatless Monday dinner or you're a vegetarian, lean on that trusty cast iron skillet to churn out hearty meals that fit that bill, like macaroni and cheese and eggplant Parmesan.

Meaty Skillets

If you'd rather a more meat-filled option, though, there are always plenty of those. Use your cast iron skillet to brown and cook chicken and pork chops with vegetables or let it help you make ridiculously awesome pizza.
