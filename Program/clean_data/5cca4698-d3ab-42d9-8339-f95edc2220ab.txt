Amazon’s popular Fire TV Stick never seems to be included whenever Amazon runs sales on their first party devices, and today’s $5 discount is the first they’ve run since the holiday season last year. It doesn’t support 4K like the full-sized Fire TV, but it does include a handy voice remote with full Alexa support.



For $10 less, today only, you can also opt for a refurbished Roku Express+ . While not ideal for your main home theater, the Express+ is more than good enough for, say, a bedroom TV, and it’s one of the only streaming devices you can buy in 2017 with a composite video out (don’t worry, it still has HDMI too), so it should work with basically any TV on the planet that still turns on.



Update: This deal is gone, but the Fire TV Stick is still on sale.
