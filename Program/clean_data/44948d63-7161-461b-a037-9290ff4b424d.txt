Save maps for offline use with this handy hack for the Google Maps app:

-Search the area you want to save and zoom in

-In the search bar, type 'ok maps' and hit search.

-Save and name the map

-Access the map even when you have no signal by opening up the 'My Places' tab in the app

Note that this only works for area maps, you can't save directions this way.
