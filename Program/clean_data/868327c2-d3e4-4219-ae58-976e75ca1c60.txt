As I’m writing this, the McKay family is about to head off for our annual family vacation.

There’s a surprising number of to-dos that need to be crossed off before heading out for any trip, and prior to every vacation, I generate the same mental checklist of things that need to be taken care of. But every single time, I procrastinate, try to cram too many tasks into the morning of our trip, and end up forgetting things to do and items to pack.

So taking a lesson from the post I wrote on the power of checklists, I finally decided to create a pre-travel checklist to get all my ducks in a row.

I figured others might find it helpful to either copy or remix it for their own travel use. I hope you find it useful and please add your own suggestions in the comments!

Leaving for Vacation Checklist

A Week to 48 Hours Before:

Put a hold on the delivery of your mail, or ask someone to collect it for you (same goes for any packages that might be coming your way)

Put a hold on the delivery of your newspapers

Arrange pet sitter or kennel stay

Pay bills

Check toiletry/gear/clothes supply — buy new items as needed

Load up on reading material — buy magazines and books, check out books from library, download books on Kindle/iPad

Order and pick-up a refill on your medication if it’ll run out while you’re on your trip

Let friends and family know about travel itinerary

Arrange for a ride to the airport, or reserve a parking spot (if your airport is big enough for that to be needed — not the case here in Tulsa!)

The Day Before:

Throw away perishable food items from fridge, as well as any fruit/veggies that might go bad while you’re away

Notify alarm company that you’ll be away

Get all laundry done (including bed sheets — nothing better than coming home to fresh sheets!)

Check-in for flight online and print off boarding passes

Print off driving directions (yeah, you can look these up on your phone, but there are plenty of times when your digital map of choice doesn’t work properly)

Write down/print off destination addresses

Check weather of destination

Confirm hotel reservations

Confirm rental car reservations

Program phone numbers you’ll need into phone

Download apps, music, and movies/shows for yourself and the kids

Set up email away message

Fully charge phone/tablet/laptop

Withdraw cash and change it for single dollar bills in case you need to tip shuttle drivers, skycaps, hotel valets, etc.

Call bank to let them know you’re traveling

Run the dishwasher

Pack everything (minus what you’ll be using on travel day) in your suitcase and carry-on bag

Morning of Departure:

Note: If you have a very early flight, some of these things should be done the night before. Just grab a protein bar and head out the door.

Pack dopp kit after getting ready for the day

Make sure all doors and windows are shut and locked

Make sure the garbage disposable is clear of food scraps

Take out last bag of trash to garbage can

Wash any dishes you used for breakfast by hand and put away (really, protein bars are the way to go)

Turn off lights and turn on timer for lights

Unplug electronics

Water house plants

Set thermostat for away temperature (upper 70s in summer, upper 50s in winter — the rule of thumb is 4 degrees off of what your normal temperature is)

Close blinds and curtains

Double-check bags/clothing for loose ammunition

Be sure your EDC is TSA compliant; pack into suitcase the forbidden items that you normally carry on your person (pocket knife, gun, etc.)

Double check that you have IDs and itinerary packed in carry-on bag

Check for items you often use right up until leaving, and end up forgetting:

Medicine

Sunglasses

Wallet

Phone

Dopp Kit:

Travel bottle of shampoo

Bar of your favorite soap

Deodorant

Toothbrush, toothpaste, floss

Shaving supplies: razor, brush, and cream

Lint roller

$20 bill

Extra pair of contact lenses

Cologne

Medications

Carry-on:

Itinerary

Smartphone power cords and adapter

Tablet/laptop and power cords

Paper copy of driving directions

A change of clean underwear

Pens/pencils

Notebooks

Headphones

Snacks

Baby/Toddler Bag:

Diapers

Diaper disposal bags

Wipes

Snacks

Books (way, way more than you might think you’ll need — they’ll go through ‘em quick)

Small toys

Bottle/cup with built-in straw (sucking will help pop their ears)

Benadryl and/or Tylenol (see here for proper dosing)

Toddler headphones

Tablet with downloaded movies/shows
