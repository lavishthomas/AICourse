So the last month has been a bit mad for me as I’ve been finishing my cookbook before we start shooting it on Monday, which is so exciting! In order to get it finished though I’ve been recipe testing hundreds of recipes over the last few weeks and I have to admit that I’m now pretty full! All the recipes have been so unbelievably delicious and I’m so excited to share them all with you in the book, but I think my stomach definitely wants a few days of eating just three meals a day, not eight! As I go back to three meals a day I’ve been really craving soup, probably because it’s light and feels so energising. To begin with I was making lots of my favourite roasted tomato and red pepper soup but then I decided that I wanted something even more warming and nourishing, which is how I created this recipe. This turmeric and lentil soup is just amazing, it’s the most comforting soup ever. The lentils, carrots and coconut milk together make it so thick and creamy, while the turmeric, garlic, mustard seeds and cumin give it such a deep, rich flavour so every spoonful really bursts with delicious goodness. I love serving it topped with sautéed cannellini beans and mushrooms, as these make it even more flavoursome, plus they add texture to the smooth soup and make it much heartier, so it feels like more of a meal.

Serves 2

– 1 and a 1/2 cups of water (300ml)

– 1/4 a cup of split red lentils (50g)

– 6 carrots (700g)

– 6 tablespoon of coconut milk

– 2 tablespoons of olive oil

– 3 cloves of garlic

– 1 tablespoon of mixed herbs (I use herbs de provence)

– 1 teaspoons of turmeric

– 1 teaspoons of cumin

– 1 teaspoons of mustard seeds

– salt and pepper

For the beans:

– 1 can of cannellini beans beans (400g)

– a dozen chestnut mushrooms

– 2 cloves garlic

– 1 tablespoon of dried herbs

Pre-heat the oven to 180C

Then peel the carrots and shop them into slices, place the slices on a baking tray with some olive oil, salt, pepper and mixed herbs. Peel the three garlic cubes and add these to the tray too. Now place the tray in the oven and allow the carrots to cook for about twenty-five minutes, until they’re nice and soft.

While the carrots cook make the lentils, simple place them in a pan of boiling water and allow them to boil for about ten minutes, then let them simmer for ten minutes until they’re totally soft.

Just before the carrots and lentils finish cooking, place the olive oil in a frying pan with the turmeric, cumin and mustard seeds and let them cook until the mustard seeds start popping.

Place the cooked carrots and garlic in a blender with the lentils and the fried herbs, then add the coconut milk and water and blend until smooth and creamy.

Then place the blended soup in a pan to warm while you make your beans and mushrooms.

Finally drain your beans and slice your mushrooms into thin pieces, place these in the frying pan that you used to fry the herbs – this means that the mushrooms and beans will soak up the leftover deliciousness from the pan! Then add two crushed cloves of garlic, a sprinkling of dried herbs and some olive oil and sauté them for about three to four minutes, until the mushrooms turn slightly brown.

Pour your soup into bowls and add the mushrooms and beans onto, then enjoy!
