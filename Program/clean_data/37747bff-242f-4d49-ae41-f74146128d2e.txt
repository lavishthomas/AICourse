Sign in to your Partners account at www.google.com/partners. Click My profile in the "Overview" section. In the "Public profile" section of the page, click the Share with drop-down menu and select "Public" to make your profile visible to others.

Keep in mind that you can change your profile's visibility status at anytime by clicking the Share with drop-down menu and selecting a different setting. Tip If you access your public profile while signed in to your Partners account, your profile's visibility status will appear in a notification at the top of the page.

Updating your name for your certificate or public profile page

If the name that appears on your individual certificate or public profile page is incorrect, you'll need to update that information in your Partners account. To do so, you'll need to edit your Google Account information.

Sign in to your Google Account at accounts.google.com. Click the Edit profile link. You'll go to your Google+ profile page. Click your name to edit it. You'll see a box where you can edit your first or last name. Keep in mind that editing your profile name in Google+ will change your name in all the Google products you use for this account (for example, if your Gmail was linked to that same Google Account, then your name would change in Gmail, too). Keep in mind that you can only change the name on your Google Account three times per year.
