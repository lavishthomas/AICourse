TERIYAKI CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES

Serves 4

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Total Time: 25 minutes

Ingredients

–1 tablespoon olive oil

–1-½ pounds boneless chicken thighs, chopped

–8 ounces broccoli florets

–2 cloves garlic, minced

–3 large carrots, sliced on the bias

–Chili flakes, to taste (optional)

Teriyaki Sauce

–2 tablespoons ginger, minced

–⅓ cup soy sauce

–⅓ cup water

–4 tablespoons corn starch

–¼ cup honey

Directions

In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, combine all of the ingredients for the teriyaki sauce. Stir occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Set aside. Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, then add the chicken in a single layer. Let cook, undisturbed, for about 3 minutes or until browned, then flip and cook the other side until browned. Add the garlic, carrots and teriyaki sauce, and let simmer for 5 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, steam the broccoli. Add the steamed broccoli to the cooked chicken and sauce. Sprinkle with chili flakes, if using, and toss to mix. Serve with rice or udon noodles.
