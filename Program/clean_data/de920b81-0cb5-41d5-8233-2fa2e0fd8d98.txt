How? Stored body fat causes inflammation, the prime source of strokes, cancers, diabetes — all the bad boys. Plus, it makes you look funny and feel bad about yourself. Makes you old.

What Is Dead Food?

Filler: This is everything we're taught to love: bread, white rice, white pasta, sugar, chips, soft drinks.

Processed food: Prepared items top this list: frozen meals, snacks, desserts. And weird stuff like ketchup.

Fast food: Think of your beloved french fries, cheeseburgers, milk shakes, griddle cakes and anything else that can be fried.

An Eating Strategy for Life

Build the perfect plate

Your plate should be 50 percent veggies and fruit, 25 percent whole grains, and 25 percent meat, poultry or fish.

Quit the Clean Plate Club

Your sainted mother was wrong — it's bad to clean your plate. The iron rule: Exercise more; eat less.

Don't drink your calories

Sugar-laden colas, milk shakes and sports drinks are awash in calories but don't make you feel full.

Limit the booze

Having one or two glasses of wine a night is fine. Having 17 is not.
