A Survival Guide to Data Science with R

These draft chapters weave together a collection of tools for the data scientistâ€”tools that are all part of the R Statistical Software Suite.

Each chapter is a collection of one (or more) pages that cover particular aspects of the topic. The chapters can be worked through as a hands-on guide to a specific task and then used as a reference guide. Each page aims to be a bite sized chunk for hands-on learning, building on what has gone before. Many chapters also have a lecture pack and a laboratory session where a number of tasks can be completed. The R code sitting behind each chapter is also provided and can be easily run standalone to replicate the material presented in the chapter.

The material begins with an overview of how an organisation should go about setting up their Analytics capability and then introduce the Data Scientist to R.
