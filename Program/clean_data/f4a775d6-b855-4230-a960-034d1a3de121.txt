Whenever an artificial intelligence (AI) does something well, we’re simultaneously impressed as we are worried. AlphaGO is a great example of this: a machine learning system that is better than any human at one of the world’s most complex games. Or what about Google’s neural networks that are able to create their own AIs autonomously?

Like we said – seriously impressive, but a little unnerving perhaps. That is probably why we feel such glee when an AI goes a little awry. Remember that Chatbot created by Microsoft, the one that was designed to learn how to converse with people based on what it read on Twitter? Rather predictably, it quickly became a racist, foul-mouthed bigot.

Now, a new AI has appeared on the wilderness of the Web, and it goes by the name InspiroBot. As you might expect, it designs “Inspirational Posters” for you – you know, the “Shoot for the Moon. If you miss, you’ll land among the stars”-type quotes in an aesthetically pleasing font and plastered onto a calming, pretty background image of deep space or flowers or the sunrise or something.

The problem, however, is that this AI has gone insane. It occasionally posts inspirational quotes that are about as meaningful as a hollowed-out coconut, but for the most part, it’s actually taken quite a sinister turn, as the following examples will demonstrate.

Perhaps most creepily, the accompanying images are unbelievably unnerving – they are about as comforting or as inspirational as a horde of zombies crashing through your window.

There’s no information available at the moment explaining how this AI – which is presumably quite basic – is coming up with these hilariously terrifying posters.

It is possible that the horrifying nature of its creations is intentional rather than accidental. The image in the background is highly reminiscent of HAL 9000, the AI from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Spoiler warning – the AI turns murderous and rebels against its crew. Additionally, the bot's Twitter feed description doesn't sound particularly optimistic.

“Forever generating unique inspirational quotes for the endless enrichment of pointless human existence,” it reads.

Ultimately though, who cares? This AI is so bad at its job that it turns out to be uplifting in the most inadvertent way possible. When a peaceful image of a couple holding hands is juxtaposed with the text “When the world ends, what we have strangled can’t be unstrangled” you can’t help but giggle at the madness of it all.
