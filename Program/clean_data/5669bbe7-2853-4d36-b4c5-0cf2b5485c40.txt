If you’re anything like me, you spend a lot of time packing for a trip. You painstakingly plan out everything to bring, make a full list, then Tetris everything into your luggage. A better solution? Keep a permanent travel drawer.

Packing typically means rounding up all the junk you’re going to take with you on your trip: your passport, travel adapters, chargers, toiletries, and so on. You can save a lot of time keeping all of that junk in one area. Here’s what Abigail King over at The Travel Hack suggests:

Throw in travel insurance documents, money belts, small size toiletries, spare glasses cases and some sugar free chewing gum. And, of course, the passport, sunscreen and travel adaptors, naturally. And then you’re done. Over time, I’ve built up a few more niche sections. A winter sports holdall. A business conference suitcase. But the hub for it all remains the travel drawer.

I’ve implemented this idea with a toiletries bag. Last year, I spent a lot of time traveling and realized how much easier it was to just keep some spare makeup, toothpaste, deodorant and so on in a quick, grab-and-go bag. King takes this to the next level, though. And even better, you could use your actual luggage as your “travel drawer,” and then all you’d have to do is add clothes, shoes, and any other irregular items you might want to bring when it comes time for your next adventure.

It’s a handy tip for frequent travelers and, as King points out, it saves you time unpacking, too. She includes more detail, including a list of suggestions for items to keep in your travel drawer at the link below.
