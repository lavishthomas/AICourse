You may think you need food to fuel your workouts, but you are wrong.

Recently, the advice that suggests loading up on carbohydrates before exercise has been called into question. Yes, consuming carbs before exercise can increase performance in certain fields like sprinting and sports that use power movements, but it also stops the body from using stored body fat for energy, which means you are less likely to reap the reported fat burning benefits.

So, if you exercise to stay trim, going 'fasted' is the more effective option.

What does fasted mean?

Over the course of the day you go in and out of fed and fasted states. The fed state lasts for about four to six hours after your last meal, during which time your body releases insulin to lower your blood sugar, proteins and fats are absorbed by the digestive system, and glucose is transported to the muscles to be used as energy (glycogen).
