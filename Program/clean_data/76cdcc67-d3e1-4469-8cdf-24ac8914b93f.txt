As spotted by SamMobile, Netflix has added the Galaxy Note 8 to its list of HDR-supported devices, which should make the format relevant to a much bigger audience when the phone is released on September 15th. The Note 8 will be the fourth phone to support Netflix HDR video playback, joining the LG V30, and Sonyâ€™s Xperia XZ1 and XZ Premium. Only Netflix subscribers with the top-tier 4k streaming plan will be able to watch HDR video on their phones.

HDR offers better contrast ratios and color accuracy for video, but the market is currently a mess of competing standards. There are now five major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, and a format Samsung has been working with Amazon called HDR10+. Samsung started supporting HDR content on devices last year, and currently the Note 7, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, and the Note 8 all have HDR-capable displays.
