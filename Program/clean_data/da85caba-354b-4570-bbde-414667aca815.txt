Being faced with a decision—even between two positive things—can be a source of stress. Make life easier on yourself by accepting “good enough” decisions when you can.

It’s no secret that humans aren’t perfect decision makers. Without the help of outside tools, we’re just not great at holding all the information we need in our heads at once. Fortunately, we don’t have to. As tips blog Barking Up the Wrong Tree points out, “good enough” decisions are usually good enough:

Make a “good enough” decision. Don’t sweat making the absolute 100% best decision. We all know being a perfectionist can be stressful. And brain studies back this up. Trying to be perfect overwhelms your brain with emotions and makes you feel out of control.

Of course, there are always exceptions. Who you marry and what career you choose are important, and it’s okay to think those over. What you eat for dinner or what movie you watch? Those don’t matter as much. The less you worry over making the right decision when it doesn’t matter, the less it’s going to stress you out thinking about the decisions that do matter.
