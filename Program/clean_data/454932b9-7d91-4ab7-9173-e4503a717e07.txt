Web: Most travel sites will ask you for your destination before you showing you the airfare. GeniusFlight puts the budget first in your travel search, and suggests international destinations based on how much you are willing to spend on plane tickets.

Select your currency before you start, set a budget, choose your departure and arrival dates, and key in the place you will be leaving from. The price is per person and includes taxes, so there won't be hidden costs later. And for the best deal, book eight weeks in advance.

GeniusFlight will then search through the airfare options (it uses Skyscanner at the backend) and give you a list of possible destinations within your parameters. The destinations are plotted on a map, which you can quickly filter by a list of available countries next to it. If money is what has been holding you back from travelling internationally, GeniusFlight makes your search and choices easier.
