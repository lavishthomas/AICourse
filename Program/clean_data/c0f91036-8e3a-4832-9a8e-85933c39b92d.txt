Whether you're gluten-free or just looking to eat fewer grains and processed foods, chickpea flour (available at all health stores and most supermarkets) is a great alternative to traditional wheat flour. Its flavor is more subtle than other alternative flours like almond or coconut, meaning that it will blend right in with whatever you're making with it.
