Personal finance is simple, but it isn’t easy. Our greedy brains try to fight us every step of the way—which is why automating your finances is such a great way to save money. Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich, puts everything you need to know in one simple graphic.

Automating your money works because you’re paying yourself first: if you automatically deposit a certain percentage of your paycheck to your savings, 401k, and other investments, you won’t be tempted to spend it later on. As Warren Buffet puts it, “Don’t save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.”

Sethi’s chart (which is fairly old, but we just discovered) is a graphical step-by-step of the process he’s explained many times before, both in his book (which we love) and in a video, which we posted years ago. But if you’re more of a visual learner, this chart makes it simple. Just adjust the percentages to fit your budget, and set up your automatic withdrawals and bill payments as described on the bottom. You’ll be saving money in no time.
