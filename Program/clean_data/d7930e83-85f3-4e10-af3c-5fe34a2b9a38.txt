It took many years and several astronomers to properly name and locate NGC 178, a dwarf galaxy with prolific star formation. It was first spotted in 1885 by American astronomer Ormond Stone, but logged in the wrong location in the sky. It was “rediscovered” by French astronomer Stéphane Javelle, who named it IC 39. Finally many years later, the confusion was solved by another American astronomer Herbert Howe.

This photo captures what it looks like at the start and finish of totality, when sunlight pierces the very edge of the moon.
