HELLO FRIENDS. I am announcing this everywhere because I’m very excited about it. I released a new zine today! Read it here! Read all my zine things at jvns.ca/zines!

This zine is about some of my favorite Linux debugging tools, especially tools that I don’t think are as well-known as they should be. It covers strace , opensnoop / eBPF , and dstat ! netcat , netstat , tcpdump , wireshark , and ngrep ! And there’s a whole section on perf because perf is the best.

If you don’t know what any of those tools I just mentioned are – PERFECT. You are who this zine is for!!! Read it and find out why I love them! Also, a lot of these tools happen to work on OS X :)

I’ve been really delighted to see that a ton of people have enjoyed & learned something new from this zine, whether they just started using Linux (!!!) or have been debugging on Linux for 10 years.

As usual, there are 3 versions. If you print it, you can print as many as you want! Give them to your friends! Teach them about tcpdump!
