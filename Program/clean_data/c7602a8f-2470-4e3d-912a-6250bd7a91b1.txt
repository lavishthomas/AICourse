You don’t have to spend a lot of money upgrading your home. If you’ve got $1,000—or even less—you can revamp your home to make it more aesthetically pleasing and more functional.



Trulia bills its list of 10 affordable upgrades as ones that will increase your home value, but I think many of them, such as installing a programmable thermostat or adding more three-prong outlets, are more for your own enjoyment rather than things that will convince others to buy your home. Others, like replacing the entry door, do have an amazing return on investment for when you sell the house.

One great suggestion from the article: Have your bathtub reglazed. My house came with an awful pink bathtub, but paying a pro $450 to make it white and sparkly again was well worth the investment. There are DIY kits, but having witnessed the labor and expertise that went into it—and the fumes—this is one home improvement you might want to hire a pro for rather than DIY.
