A crowd of people were caught up in an "acid attack" at the Notting Hill Carnival this weekend.

The Metropolitan Police said a "mild acidic liquid" was thrown over a number of people at St Charles Square, near to Ladbroke Grove, just before 8pm on Sunday.

Three people reported "skin irritation" not thought to be serious, while two more were hurt in a subsequent stampede, when the liquid was thrown.

No arrests have yet been made in connection with it.

A spokesman said: "Some of the crowd in the area then quickly dispersed, causing injuries to two people, who have since received treatment from the London Ambulance Service at the scene.

"Three people have also reported skin irritation injuries, although these are not thought to be serious."
