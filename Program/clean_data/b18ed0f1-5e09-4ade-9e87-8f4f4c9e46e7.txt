Andy Murray’s work ethic is behind his rise to No1 and he can stay there | Kevin Mitchell Read more

Andy Murray can finally enjoy a few quiet weeks as the king of tennis – last week he became the world’s No 1 player for the first time in his career. As the tennis year ends in November, he can now remain top of the pile until the next season begins in January.

Murray’s victory over Novak Djokovic at the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour Finals last Sunday made him one of only four players to lead the rankings in the past 12 years. The top spot has been dominated by Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the past decade. Federer held the position for a total of five years during that time.

This year, Murray exceeded his 2015 score by 46%, topping the table with 12,685 points. (That wouldn’t have been enough to win in 2015: Djokovic was top with 16,585 points.) The numbers also describe the falls of Nadal and Federer: both struggled this year, suffering from injuries and missed matches.
