Easy, 4 ingredient vegan parmesan cheese that's perfect on top of pastas, pizza and anywhere you'd usually use parmesan cheese!

Author: Minimalist Baker Recipe type: Vegan, Cheese Cuisine: Vegan, Gluten Free Serves: ~1 cup

Ingredients 3/4 cup (90 g) raw cashews

3 Tbsp (9 g) nutritional yeast

3/4 tsp sea salt

1/4 tsp garlic powder

Instructions Add all ingredients to a food processor and mix/pulse until a fine meal is achieved. Store in the refrigerator to keep fresh. Lasts for several weeks. I love vegan parmesan on top of chilaquiles, vegan pizza, breadsticks, pastas and gratins. It's also a great addition to vegan meatballs and can be converted into mexican cheese 3 ways!

Notes *This is not my original recipe, but one I learned from other vegan bloggers and have adapted for my own use!
