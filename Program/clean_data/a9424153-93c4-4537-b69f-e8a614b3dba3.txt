When I was around 5 or 6 years old, I discovered how much I enjoyed writing. My parents gave me a Playskool recorder (the one with that long, curly yellow cord) and I carried that thing around everywhere — to the grocery store to interview strangers, to my friend’s houses, or chasing my dog around the backyard asking her for a comment.

I consider myself among the very lucky few who have always known exactly what I wanted to do with my life, and luckily, I’ve had parents who supported whatever that was.

And if you ask my mom, it wasn’t so much that I was born a natural writer with a thirst for words — but more so, that my sign indicated I might be interested in journalism.

She’s an astrologer, and while she’s always careful to indicate that personal choice outweighs any prediction from the solar system, she often explains how our zodiac sign can shape who we are, what we think, and what makes us happy.

It can also indicate what type of career we would excel in, along with what we might struggle with in the office. Here’s what you should be doing with your life, according to my mom, the astrologer. (No pressure.)
