What if Game of Thrones was freed of its medieval shackles, and set in 2019? How would the great houses of Lannister, Stark, Targaryen and, erm, Greyjoy, fare in an internet age? Sure, civilisation has progressed beyond bear pits but with global warming and international political turmoil, the slings and arrows of fortune between author George RR Martin's time scale and that of modern life aren't so far removed.

That's what Westeros the Series argues, at least. On Tuesday night, as fans were recovering from watching the last episode of Game of Thrones season seven, a trailer emerged on YouTube. It shows themes and characters recognisable to fans of the show but in contemporary times: crowds are illuminated by stadium lights, tower blocks rise and wind pylons turn, perched on the gates of Braavos.

The silver hair of a Targaryen strokes a mirror lined with cocaine while the white feet of a Direwolf follows a pair of nude stilettos. The closing scene shows the shadow of a winged beast cast above what could well be Targaryen Square, Manhattan.
