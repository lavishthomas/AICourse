When I'm in the mood for a big bowl of flavor-packed vegetables, this is the recipe for me. Curried quinoa with caramelized broccoli and cauliflower makes for a high-protein meal that comes together in less than 30 minutes and makes me feel great. It's a perfect weeknight dinner.

Why this recipe works:

Caramelizing the broccoli and cauliflower makes it sweet and nutty. Removing it from the pot and adding it back at the end ensures that it stays crisp and crunchy.

Toasting spices helps them develop flavor and distributes that flavor evenly throughout the dish.

We cook everything in a single pot, minimizing on clean-up.
