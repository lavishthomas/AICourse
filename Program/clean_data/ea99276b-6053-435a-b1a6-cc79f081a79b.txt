No, it isn’t cheese…even though it kind of looks like it.

Instead, it’s a creamy, flavorful alternative to the dairy stuff that will leave you richly satisfied in your decision to leave the cows alone.

I always feel bad when a non-vegan tastes vegan “cheese” for the first time. Like, how can this stuff be described except to call it a cheese alternative? We all know that, in reality, not a single one of the veg “cheese” alternatives out there tastes like real cheese.

Therefore, may I introduce you to not-real-cheese-but-still-delicious-creamy-yellow-sauce-over-macaroni??

Okay, that’s just way too cumbersome.

Whatevs. Call it “cheese.” Just give your non-veg friends a fair warning, mkay?

A few weeks ago, I discovered this recipe for vegan macaroni and cheese which was described by VegNews to be the “best on the planet.” I knew I had to give it a try, but that I couldn’t exactly follow the recipe (because, as you probably know by now, I don’t follow recipes). The original recipe calls for over 1/3 cup of vegan margarine. I just couldn’t do it. I use plenty of vegan margarine in cakes and desserts, when I eat them, but for mac and cheese? For Little M?

I just had to replace it with something else. And then, I had to add a few more items, because y’all know that’s my nature.

So, today I bring you my crazily adapted recipe and what has become my favorite vegan mac and cheese–with no refined oil.

Who knew that potatoes, carrots, onion, cashews, coconut milk, and seasonings could make such a fabulous creamy combination? And that, when mixed with macaroni, that crazy combination will make your taste buds leap for joy?

Can I just eat it out of the pan like a bachelor?

Okay, I’ll lay aside my strong animal-like urge to devour and take a moment to sprinkle paprika and parsley on the top.

And that, my friends, is as far as got with photographing this bowl of yumminess before I starting eating it. Sometimes, you just can’t wait any longer, you know?
