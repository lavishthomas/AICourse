You can rid your garden of pests naturally using a number of clever methods, but when you need to deter insects in real time a caffeine spray can do the trick without harming your plants. Jenny Sigler, writing for healthy living site Spark People, shares her recipe:

While humans tend to enjoy the burst of energy that comes from caffeine, insects, particularly aphids, do not. Gather any or all of the following herbs: yarrow, tansy, pennyroyal, thyme, lavender, rue, catnip and artemisia. Mix at least a cup of this herbal mixture with 2 tablespoons used coffee grounds and 2 cups of water. Allow this to marinate for at least 24 hours before straining and placing into a spray bottle. This can keep for several weeks.

This mixture requires a bit of work, but will keep your plants safe and get rid of pests easily. Presumably you could use it to stop insects in other situations as well, even outside of your garden.
