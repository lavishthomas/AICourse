Two thirds of cancers are unavoidable even if you live a healthy life, a study has shown.

Scientists in the US found cancers are caused by random mistakes in the genetic code that occur when cells divide.

The findings challenge the widespread view that cancer mutations are generally inherited or triggered by environmental factors.

Instead, the vast majority of cancers are probably down to unlucky defects in replicating DNA that occur out of the blue, they suggest.
