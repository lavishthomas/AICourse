Emily Tsitrian, 32, is head of consulting services at PlanGrid in San Francisco, Calif.

Q. What does PlanGrid do and what is your role there?

A. We’re a software company that markets the PlanGrid app for construction workers, everyone from laborers to electrical foremen to project managers. It digitizes information used on construction sites, such as blueprints, so that the information is easier to use. I lead a team that trains the workers on how to use it on their smartphone or an iPad. We also design work flows for clients.

What is your background?

I grew up in a small town in South Dakota, and I wasn’t ready for college after high school. In my early 20s I worked for the forest service and in the food industry, and also helped build trails in Yosemite National Park with AmeriCorps. Eventually I attended the University of California at Berkeley and got a bachelor’s in economics.

How did waiting to attend college help you?

Working menial jobs motivated me academically. Catering was the worst; I’d fold salami as appetizers for corporate events.

What are your challenges?

Initially we thought we’d use webinars and YouTube videos to teach our app, but we found that for construction workers, training has to be mostly in person. I hold classes in a construction trailer or train someone on the fly where they’re working.
