Yup, you read that right: You get to eat healthy protein, healthy fats, healthy carbs—there’s hardly anything you need to give up on this program. Ice cream? Sure, have it. Grilled cheese sandwiches? Yup. They're in.

These are among the best sources of protein, fiber, and all the other ingredients and nutrients that help fight fat. In fact, they're so good for you that they'll just about single-handedly exchange your fat for a toned, lean body and sexy abs. You can base entire meals and snacks around them, but you don't have to. Just be sure to follow these simple rules.

* Incorporate two or three of these foods into each of your meals and at least one of them into each snack.

* Diversify your food at every meal to get a combination of protein, carbohydrates, and fat.

* Sneak a little protein into each snack.
