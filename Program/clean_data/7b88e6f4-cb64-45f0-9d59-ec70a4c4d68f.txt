Tofu sometimes gets a reputation for being bland, but that's not the case in this quick stir-fry. Simply toss some meaty baked tofu in a spicy Asian marinade with tons of bold flavor. Packaged stir-fry mix and pre-sliced shiitake mushrooms can easily be found in the produce section of most grocery stores, and make it possible for this healthy meal to come together in 15 minutes or less.
