Lots of people choose paleo because it makes them feel healthier (eating lots of fresh, whole foods will have that effect!). But some people choose paleo as a means of losing weight or achieving a certain body composition that they find desirable. And if thatâ€™s your goal, you'll have to pay attention to how much you're eating.

"A paleo diet is really good, because all of the foods are really nutrient dense," Giovinazzo says. "But if you're eating quality food and not getting the body composition results you want, then you need to look at quantity." She says that people often go crazy with healthy fats. "They start adding avocado to everything, and they use a lot of coconut oil, and they eat a lot of nuts." For weight loss, you should only be eating one serving of fat with every meal, and maybe one additional serving as a snack.

Here's what one serving looks like:

1 serving of nuts = 1 ounce

1 serving of nut butter = 2 tablespoons

1 serving of avocado = 1/4 avocado

1 serving of coconut oil/olive oil = 1 tablespoon
