Halfway through the second set of a Fed Cup match between Britain's Johanna Konta and Romania's Sorana Cirstea this spring, play was dramatically suspended. Romanian team captain Ilie Nastase—a former world number one who played against the likes of John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors in the '70s—was ejected from the court after calling Konta and UK captain Anne Keothavong "fucking bitches." Nastase had already, the day before, been put under investigation by the International Tennis Federation after storming into the pressroom and lighting into "stupid, ugly" British sports correspondent Eleanor Crooks. The tirade was inspired by a story Crooks had written in which she'd quoted him musing about Serena Williams's then-unborn baby: "Let's see what color it has—chocolate with milk?" Remarkably, even that incident wasn't Nastase's first scandal of the tournament, held in the seaside town of Constanta, Romania. At the event's kickoff gala, he'd openly hit on the married, pregnant Keothavong, asking for her room number within earshot of reporters and putting his arm around her as she cringed. The next day, when the two were once again near each other, he announced, "We keep being attracted!"

On the one hand, this behavior is so cartoonish as to be almost dismissible. From his entitled swagger to his Don Johnson–circa–Miami Vice hairdo, the 71-year-old Nastase comes across like a mascot for the patriarchy, the kind of guy any woman with her radar up for crude, boorish men would immediately avoid. But Nastase's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad weekend capped off a banner year for sexism in tennis. First, in March 2016, there was the forced resignation of the director of the famed Indian Wells tournament, Raymond Moore, for saying that female tennis stars "ride on the coattails of the men" and that if he were born a "lady player, I'd go down every night on my knees and thank God that Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal were born." Then came the assertion by Ion Tiriac, the Madrid Open director, that equal pay in the sport isn't merited—though he hastened to add, according to the New York Times, "I like, very much more, women than men.… The longer the legs theirs are, the more beautiful I think they are." And finally, there was the abundant testimony by male players that the wage gap in tennis—like American women, female players make something like 80 cents on the dollar compared to men—is justified because the women's game is plainly inferior to the men's. It's "a different product, which is better," as Ukrainian player Sergiy Stakhovsky put it. Both Novak Djokovic, ranked fourth in the world, and France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, ranked tenth, graciously added that women can't help it that they're not as good as the men, what with their "hormones" and all.

Against this antediluvian backdrop— especially remarkable considering that Serena Williams is the winningest player of her generation—one male player stands out as an advocate for equality, and he happens to be the top player in the world right now: Britain's Andy Murray. A scruffy, laconic Scotsman, Murray comes across more as a dark antihero than an airbrushed leading man. And yet, "Andy's been great, and without even realizing it, probably," says Billie Jean King, the former champion and feminist activist who played Bobby Riggs in the infamous 1973 Battle of the Sexes—a match instigated by Riggs's prattle about how women's tennis was "so far beneath men's." (King won.)

Oddly, perhaps, it's Murray's lack of slickness, his tendency toward sometimes ill-advised frankness with the media, that makes him such a powerful defender of the cause: He has a knack for making the other side look ridiculous. In response to the fact that some male doubles players—feeling shortchanged in terms of access to practice courts, gym sessions, and prime TV time—want to ban women from coed tournaments, Murray offered, "My brother is a doubles player, I support doubles—but why don't we fight to get better facilities instead of saying, 'Let's get rid of the women,' you know?"

Nicole Gibbs, a 24-year-old American up-and-comer known on the tennis circuit for addressing social issues, says she loves Murray's matter-of-factness. "He's labeled a radical feminist," she says, "but his attitude is, This is obvious."

"There's a perception that the women don't handle pressure as well as the men, but it's not true," Murray says.

While 2016 may have been a rough year for "lady players" (in their quest for equality at least), it was an exalted one for Murray. Long viewed as the brooding perpetual runner-up to the so-called Big Three (Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic), Murray relieved Djokovic of the number one ranking he'd held for an astonishing 121 weeks in the fall and then solidified his hold on the spot by beating him at the World Tour finals in November. The victory was especially sweet for Murray because it took place at London's O2 arena—not far from where he lives with his wife, Kim Sears, and their one-year-old daughter, Sophia. (Sears was pregnant with the couple's second child at press time.)

Murray's ascension really began back in fall 2015, when he led the British Davis Cup team to its first win in 79 years. Then, in 2016, as he traversed the globe from Melbourne to Cincinnati to Shanghai, Murray went on to amass 87 wins, including three prestigious Masters 1,000 titles, plus Wimbledon and, after a grueling, four-hour contest against Argentinian Juan Martín del Potro, his second Olympic gold. He only seemed to pick up steam as the year progressed, prevailing in his last 25 consecutive matches and making the finals in 12 of the last 13 tournaments he played. In an era where Murray's immediate peers are widely acknowledged as contenders for the GOAT ("greatest of all time") crown, tennis watchers credit the British player's indomitable will as much as anything for his takeover. "He's been the most consistent player on all surfaces; he's just not giving anything away these days," said former world number one Martina Navratilova when Murray moved into the top slot. She also commented on the fact that at 29, he was the oldest first-time number one in the last 42 years: "The fact that it came this late in his playing career just tells you how determined and focused he is. It's a testament to his character."

As was, by many people's lights, Murray's willingness to use his megaphone on behalf of women at every opportunity he got during his season of dominance. Right after the Indian Wells foolishness, he told reporters, "The timing of it was just so strange. It was right before you had a great women's final with, like, 16,000 people sitting in the stadium." He picked a deliciously snarky—and amusingly macho, under the circumstances—Twitter fight with Stakhovsky: Who could draw a bigger crowd, Murray taunted, the Ukrainian or the top British woman, Laura Robson? "I played you in a Davis Cup match in Ukraine and there must have been a thousand people there max!" Murray tweeted. When Stakhovsky responded by questioning Murray's math, Murray retorted: "How many empty seats were there, Serge? I wasn't counting, was focusing on getting the W." Then, mere moments after Murray won gold again at the Rio Olympics, he corrected the BBC's John Inverdale when he congratulated Murray for being the first person ever to win two golds in tennis. "Well, to defend the singles title," Murray replied, without missing a beat. "Venus and Serena have won about four each, but hadn't defended a singles title before." (He's exactly right: The Williams sisters have each won a gold in singles and three golds together in doubles.)

"It's hard for men to understand the lack of respect that's out there," says Steve Simon, CEO of the Women's Tennis Association. Even during the time I was reporting this piece, another mini-scandal broke, when John McEnroe told a reporter that if Serena were playing on the men's tour, she'd be ranked "like 700," appearing to nod to the hoary perspective that a woman has to hit as hard as a man to be worth as much as a man. Another way the disrespect manifests is in the "separate but equal" argument: male players nonchalantly maintaining in public that there's not enough room for the women at combined tournaments, which include both sexes, even though these events are the most commercially valuable in the sport. So what, exactly, is these guys' problem? "It's ego, ego, ego," concludes King. "As a woman, I've lived through it. And they're shooting themselves in the foot, because so few sports have men and women together like ours. We have such a unique opportunity, and we don't take full advantage of it."

As for the uneven paydays, it's not that female superstars like Serena or Maria Sharapova or any of the tippy-top tour players aren't making a killing. They are. Serena earned $7.7 million in prize money in 2016 and is the highest-paid woman athlete in the world, having raked in another $19 million in endorsements this past year. But still, why should she earn less for defending her title at, say, the Western & Southern Open than her male counterpart at the same tournament?

Anyway, it's the players gutting it out week after week ranked around where Nicole Gibbs is—hovering at 100 in the world—who are most affected. According to an analysis conducted in 2014 by the International Tennis Federation, 336 male players earned enough to cover the cost of playing on tour, versus only 253 females. Among the male players, it's considered a classy, almost chivalrous pose to support women being paid well for their play, but parity? Be serious. "The fact that it hasn't been stigmatized yet is really upsetting," Gibbs says. "My quote-unquote friends on the ATP tour will casually joke, like, 'You really think women should make the same?' And nobody is like, 'Hey, you're an asshole.' "

Murray was cast both as Britain's great hope to win Wimbledon and as unworthy of the role.

"Um, a little bit," Murray demurs when I ask if he feels like he's the only male player standing up for the women. It's the middle of April, and we're sitting in a cloistered clump of overstuffed couches in a hotel bar in Barcelona, where he's participating in a clay court warm-up tournament leading into the French Open. "I certainly wouldn't be the only one, but what I just don't get is why it wouldn't be something that tennis players are proud of, like, to be the only sport [where the male and female game and earnings] are even comparable. That's positive. We still have so many issues, but it's something that tennis players should celebrate."

To hang out with Murray is to be treated to a relentless and relentlessly entertaining dance between his two personalities: well-bred British global-superstar athlete and gleefully profane Scotsman. He has won the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year award three times and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at the end of 2016. Yet later, when we're pulling into the Sánchez-Casal tennis academy where he used to train, Murray will gesture across the street and casually announce: "There always used to be prostitutes at the end of this road. Always. We had to walk past them to get the bus into the city…. And this stinks right here, this is a sewer—it's sewage." A moment later, he hops out of the front seat to open the entrance gate for our car.

Murray grew up in the small town of Dunblane, Scotland, which gained worldwide attention in 1996, when a local man walked into the lone elementary school with four handguns and murdered 16 children and one teacher. (It remains one of the deadliest mass shootings in UK history and led to dramatic limits on gun possession in that country.) But to the Murray family, Dunblane was home. Andy and his older brother, Jamie, a two-time Grand Slam doubles winner, were among only a handful of kids who played tennis. "I learned how to coach because there were no coaches in our area," says his mother, Judy Murray, a former champion junior player who coached the Scottish national team and later became the British women's Fed Cup captain. (Keothavong is her successor.) "It gave me something to do while they were toddlers." Andy inherited his fierce work ethic from his mom, a witty firebrand who likes to tweet affectionately embarrassing photos of her and her son, as well as thoughts on her many passion projects, the latest of which is aimed at training more women to coach tennis. "She had lots of different jobs," Andy says. "She was a tennis coach; she used to run tournaments for kids at our local club. For a while, she and my gran ran the toy shop in the village where we lived, and she used to deliver sweets and stuff to newsagents" (aka newsstands). That's actually how Judy met Andy's dad, William Murray: "He worked for a newsagent."

Murray's parents separated when he was "9 or 10," he recalls, uncertainly. "I don't even know—like, my memory from when I was that young is so bad." Murray was always one of the top British juniors and traveled with the national team, but it wasn't until he was 15 and went to Barcelona to enroll at the aforementioned tennis academy that he says he committed to pursuing professional tennis. Murray has fond memories of the place. "I loved it, it's great…to get away from that," he says, referring to his parents' separation and eventual divorce. "It's just, like, freedom really—the first time being away. I never got homesick. My brother used to get pretty homesick, but I never felt that at all." (Murray reportedly remains tight with both of his parents; he and Jamie attended their father's wedding when he remarried last year.) For young Murray, tennis was joyful, an escape. "Our mum always wanted me and Jamie to have fun," he says. "And I think both of us—well, I certainly enjoyed it…until I became a professional."

By the time Murray was 18, he'd been cast by the UK sports press both as his nation's great hope to win Wimbledon for the first time in 69 years and also as unworthy of the role: too pouty (the tabloids called him "Mopey Murray"), too impolite, and too, you know, not English. "The second Wimbledon I played, I'm walking to my match and a lady on her mobile phone goes, 'Oh, that Scottish wanker just walked past,' " he recalls. "I was like, What? I was 19. This is my home tournament. Why is this happening?" He had the kind of combative, antagonistic relationship with the media that he appears to also have with himself on court. "I had no idea what I could and couldn't say, so I'd just say whatever was on my mind," he says. "At the start, they were like, Oh, this is a breath of fresh air, this is fantastic! But then everything you say is a big story, and you see some people like what you're saying and some people hate it, and you're like, Fuck, why don't these people like me? What have I done wrong? It's difficult."

Then something magical occurred: Murray failed. In the summer of 2012, almost 17 million of his countrymen watched him become the first British man to make the Wimbledon final since 1938, only to lose to Roger Federer in four sets. At 25, Murray had at that point played in three Grand Slam finals and lost every one. In the postmatch interview, he broke down, shakily joking, "I'm getting closer," before congratulating Federer, thanking his friends and family, and then addressing the crowd and his country directly, perhaps for the first time. "Last of all to you guys," Murray began, his voice cracking. "Everybody always talks about the pressure of playing at Wimbledon, how tough it is. But it's not the people watching: They make it so much easier to play. The support—it's been incredible. So thank you."

Perverse as it may be, there's something about seeing a person—especially one known for prickliness—laid bare that endears them to even the most skeptical fans. "The pressure and expectation was a lot," Murray says of those early years. "And the guys I was competing against, all of them would probably be in the top five of all time. It was actually when I accepted I might never [win a Grand Slam event] that things started to change a little bit for me." Though "serene" is the last word you'd use to describe Murray, there is something metaphysical and monklike about him; he's aware that it was only when he'd really internalized that he might not rise to the pinnacle of his sport that he loosened up enough to get there.

Less than a month after that ignominious defeat, on that very same Wimbledon center court, Murray beat Federer, earning his first Olympic gold (and the first singles gold for Britain in more than a century). Five weeks later, he followed that win with his first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open in September.

Murray grew up being coached by his mother, and is the only top male player to hire a female coach.

The next summer, in 2013, a BBC documentary introduced a much wider audience to Murray's droll-but-sensitive off-court personality—there is a several-minute bit in which he and his wife discuss the psychology of their two naughty dogs that is particularly charming. The film also included the first in-depth comments from the Murray family on their memories of the Dunblane shooting, which happened when Andy was 8 and Jamie, 10. Both boys attended the school where the massacre took place and knew both the victims and the assailant, who ran a local boys' club and was someone the Murrays used to give rides to. "You have no idea how tough something like that is," Murray said, tearing up in the biopic. "It's just nice that I've been able to do something the town is proud of." In July, shortly after the documentary aired, Murray won Wimbledon for the first time—and sobbed with happiness.

While Judy Murray says her coaching career started mainly out of necessity, she inadvertently exposed her sons to a rarefied experience: being coached by a woman. "I can only talk about my country, Great Britain, but I'd say only 20 percent of our tennis coaches are women," she says. "And most of them work with the younger kids or at the lower level—there is no career pathway for them." This, unequivocally, shaped Andy's perspective. "Some argue, Oh, well, she's a woman, so she can't understand the men's game," he says of female coaches in general. "But then how can a man understand the women's game? I obviously grew up getting coached by my mum, so I didn't see any issue. But even I—when I came on the professional tour, there were no men coached by women, so looking for a coach, you assume you're looking for a man, but when you get older you realize…well, no, it doesn't have to be that way."

In June 2014, Murray hired former world number one player Amélie Mauresmo as his head coach, making her the first female coach of a top player on the men's side, and one of the few female coaches at the tour level for players of either sex, full stop. The move was also noteworthy because Murray had just a few years earlier ushered in the practice of hiring former elite tour players as coaches, tapping Ivan Lendl in 2012. This has now become standard, but even six years ago, it wasn't really done. So when word broke that Murray and Lendl were parting ways, it inspired a frenzy of anticipation about which boldface name the top Brit would anoint next. Needless to say, no one expected him to pick a girl. "When it first came out in the press that I may be working with a woman, I got a message from one of the players who is now coaching. He said to me: I love this game that you're playing with the press; maybe you should tell them tomorrow that you're considering working with a dog," Murray says. "That's the sort of stuff that was said when I was thinking about it." There were a few exceptions among top male players, notably Roger Federer, who commended Mauresmo in the media. After Murray proceeded to hire her, the sexism intensified. "The amount of criticism she got in comparison to any other coach I've ever worked with—it's not comparable at all," Murray says. "Now, when I lose a match, I get the blame. When I was working with her, it was always her fault."

The experience inspired Murray—whose ranking rose from 11 to 2 with Mauresmo—to be more vocal about his politics. "It certainly highlighted a few things I hadn't given loads of thought to," he tells me. Murray wrote a kind of coming-out column for the French sports newspaper L'Equipe in 2015: "Have I become a feminist? If being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man, then yes, I suppose I have." And he directly addressed attacks on Mauresmo in an on-court interview after he reached the Australian Open finals. "I think so far this week we've showed that women can be very good coaches as well," he said. "I'm very thankful to Amélie for doing it. It was a brave choice from her."

Apart from his advocacy, Murray is known as a student and true lover of the women's game. In Barcelona, he volunteers an argument to counter the oft-heard idea in tennis land that female players are more prey to their emotions than the men, the "proof" being statistics that can be interpreted to suggest that women are less likely than men to hold their serve at crunch time. But, as Murray explains, male players win more "free points" on the serve overall because of the greater velocity of their ball. "Women's [serves] get broken way more than men's in general, so obviously that's going to happen more in big moments as well," he says, sounding exasperated.

"There's a perception that women don't handle pressure as well as men do, but it's not true," Murray goes on. "A lot of the top men are very, very emotional on the courts. Not all of them. But some of them. And I would be one. I don't handle my emotions particularly well in comparison to a lot of the women. If you talked about the worst-behaved tennis players, most of them would be men." In fact, when Mauresmo left Team Murray early last year, it was reportedly related to his negativity during matches. "Andy is complex," Mauresmo told L'Equipe in a series of rare public comments (she declined to speak for this piece). "On the court, he can be the opposite of what he is in life." Toward the end, Mauresmo took to sitting in the stands rather than the players' box, in an apparent effort to give Murray less of a target for his outbursts. Still, "it was a beautiful adventure," she said in that same L'Equipe interview. "A woman coaching a man, it breaks a few barriers."

As we're driving out to visit Murray's old tennis academy, where a court is to be dedicated in his honor, I'm reminded of how he almost makes a fetish of efficiency—the previous day, I'd watched him practice spot serving like a sniper practices target shooting, hitting the same dented tennis-ball can over and over. During the trip, he can't stop extolling the virtues of Waze. "It's by far the best app I've ever downloaded. It kills me when people don't accept that technology knows more, when people are like, I'm going to take this road and that road, and I'm like, But this thing is giving you the fastest route!" Murray's wife does all the driving, he says. "I'm not allowed to. She's just not a great passenger, and it's fine," he explains, then breaks into a grin. "Until something goes wrong. Then I blame her.

"The only problem for me now is that when I lived here, I could understand a lot of what was getting said," Murray continues, under his breath, as he's greeted by a pack of ecstatic teachers and administrators. "Everyone is thinking I still understand Spanish, but I don't understand anything they're saying." After a few photos in the main office, he makes his way to Court 1 for the unveiling of a plaque in his name. As he's introduced, a pack of boys and girls of varied ages and ethnic backgrounds fidget across the net, waiting to bombard him with autograph requests. "I had an amazing time here," Murray begins, sweetly stiff behind the mic. "I learned to work hard here.... I lived here, and I did my schooling here as well. And it was great. Oh, and like Sergio said"—he's referring to his former coach, who'd introduced him—"I never expected to get to number one in the world or do anything I did, but it happened, and a lot of it started here. So thanks to everyone who is here who helped."

Then: the swarm. There are an imposing number of superphysical teenage boys—tall, lanky, and aggressive—in the house; one of them will convince Murray to hit with him on his way out. But there are also a fair number of girls, one of whom stands out. She's small, maybe 10 or 11, dark-skinned, with a giant topknot ponytail spilling out over her scrunchie and a steely, determined way about her. She's among the first to score an autograph: Murray signs the red tank top she's wearing. As he's rounding the corner to visit his old dorm, she somehow presents herself at the front of the pack once again, this time with a ball in hand, which he signs. And finally, as Murray is making his way to the car, there she is again, this time pressing a visor on him. After getting her third autograph of the day, she turns back to her friend, showing off her signed swag. Then she raises her fist to the sky triumphantly.
