The Jökulsárlón Glacial Lagoon lies on Iceland’s southern coast. It’s more than 800 feet deep and filled with chunks of ice that break off the nearby Breiðamerkurjökull Glacier.

Many tourists attractions, like this one in Stokksnes, sit on private property, and it is up to the owners to care for them.
