Drugstore mascara is great, but this stuff is MIRACULOUS. It doesn't budge, there are no clumps, and you can fan corner lashes outward with that genius domed brush head for seriously extended lashes.

SUPER IMPORTANT LIFE HACK ALERT: A Makeup Alley reviewer says: "I do like this mascara but I feel like so much of a good mascara is just in the brush applicator. When I run out of this sample I'll save the brush head, sanitize it and use it with my Revlon mascara." So do with that information what you will.
