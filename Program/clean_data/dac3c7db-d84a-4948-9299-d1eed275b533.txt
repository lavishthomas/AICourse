This is despite them appearing to have been in place when the universe was comparatively young - only a few hundred million years old.

Now the mystery could be solved by the identification of the intermediate-type black hole - something astrophysicists suspected were around but for which there have been only tentative candidates in the past.

It's believed they could be the seeds of their more massive counterparts - merging together to form a gigantic one. intermediate black holes might simply turn out to be their progenitors.

It's difficult to find black holes - because they are completely black. But in some cases they cause effects which can be seen.

A black hole is a region of space that has such an extremely powerful gravitational field that it absorbs all the light that passes near it and reflects none.

Professor Tomoharu Oka and colleagues used computer simulations to show the high velocity motion, or kinematics, of the gas could only be explained by an intermediate black ole conceal ed in its midst.
