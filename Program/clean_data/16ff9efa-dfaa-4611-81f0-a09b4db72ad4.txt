Every time you go through the day and wind up behind, you tell yourself “Tomorrow will be better.” Then you go to sleep with no idea how you’re going to accomplish that. If you want to break the cycle, start on tomorrow today.

As personal finance site How Do I Money explains, getting ahead is hardest when you expect that you can get started on it tomorrow. At the end of every day, you should have a plan for tackling tomorrow’s activities if you want to have any hope of getting out in front of the onslaught of to-dos on your list.

You want tomorrow to be better? You want to finally get a grip on things and even get on top and (dare I suggest) get ahead? Then you better plan ahead to get ahead. Tomorrow starts tonight. Wake up in the morning without a plan and it’s already too late. Bouncing around from one random thing to the next won’t work.

Trying to fit all of tomorrow’s activities into today can become an exercise in futility (though, if you can pull it off, do it!). At the very least, having a plan for how you’ll tackle the necessities means you don’t have to spend time figuring it out the next day. Every night, before you go to bed, review your list and make sure you know what you need to do the next day so that once the sun comes up, you can hit the ground running.
