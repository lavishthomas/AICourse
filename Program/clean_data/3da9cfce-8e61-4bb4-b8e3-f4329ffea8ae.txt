Tech support for wireless services, retired at 55

“You’re going to want to plan, especially if you’re married and have children … You’ve got to start thinking about how long you want to stay in your house, if you’re going to stay in your house forever? Do you want to be close to where your children are living? How long is your spouse going to work?”

Travis Newsome, 67

Finance, retired at 60

Chicago

“Retirement is not a place where you go to prepare to die, but instead a place where you just go to prepare to live. I did not know that 65 would be the new 40, and had I known that, I would have been less stressed about retirement.”



—Maria Cardona, Columbia College Chicago
