In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he has disclosed that "one of the biggest challenges" he now faces is forgiving his accuser, something he said he will do, "just not now".

He told the newspaper: "I would certainly advocate that no man qualify as a teacher. It is just not worth it. What is the lesson here? There is nothing to protect the male teacher."

A jury found Mr Harris, from Richmond, not guilty of all charges following his trial at Isleworth Crown Court.

"I had to give up my dream job because of a crime I didn't commit," he said.

"I am unemployed, living in a bedsit and will soon be on housing benefit. I am toxic."

Mr Harris, who saidhe is now considering a job in a crematorium, added: "If I knew on the day I qualified what I know now, I would never have become a teacher.
