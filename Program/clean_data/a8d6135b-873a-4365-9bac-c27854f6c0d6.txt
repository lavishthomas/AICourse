Police officers will be barred from patient-care areas at a hospital in Utah that drew widespread notice when an officer handcuffed a nurse, hospital officials said this week.

The new policy, announced at a news conference on Monday, was put into effect soon after a Salt Lake City police officer detained Alex Wubbels, who on July 26 refused to allow an officer to take a blood sample from an unconscious patient at University of Utah Hospital. Video footage of the encounter surfaced last week, leading to fierce condemnation of the police tactics, including a rally in Salt Lake City on Saturday.

In the videos, two of which were recorded by police body cameras, Ms. Wubbels can be seen explaining to the officer that she could not allow blood to be drawn from a patient unless he is under arrest, there is a warrant for his arrest or he has consented to having his blood drawn. The officer, Jeff L. Payne, handcuffed her in response, accusing her of impeding an investigation.

Ms. Wubbels was not charged with any crimes. Mr. Payne and an unnamed officer were put on administrative leave as the department conducts a criminal investigation into the episode.

On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Payne was also fired from his part-time job as a paramedic with Gold Cross Ambulance because of remarks he made that the company’s president said were “inflammatory” and “inappropriate.”
