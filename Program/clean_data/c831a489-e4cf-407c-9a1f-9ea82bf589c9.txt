A Woman Is a Woman

Now that many of these products can be found stateside at a drugstore near you, they offer the high-end quality of department store and Sephora brands at a lower price. They also might be safer because the EU has much stricter rules when it comes to the ingredients commonly used in makeup and skincare. Controversial chemicals like parabens, phthatales, sodium laureth sulfate, and petroleum are highly regulated and closely controlled. As always, do your research and read the reviews available online as well as ingredient lists if you have any allergies or sensitivities.

Bonus: these products will look very pretty and exotic sitting on your makeup counter or the rim of your bathtub.
