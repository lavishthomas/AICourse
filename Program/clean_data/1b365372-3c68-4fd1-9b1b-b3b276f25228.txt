In this brief video, Michael Pollan, the author of perhaps the best food book I've ever read, argues that the answer is surprisingly simple and it has nothing to do with calories or nutrients.

When I started learning about nutrition, about which, by the way, much less is known than you might think, I learned that what mattered most about one's health was not necessarily the nutrients, good or bad, that you were consuming, or staying away from, or even the calorie counts, but what predicted a healthy diet more than anything else is the fact that it was being cooked by a human being and not a corporation. Corporations cook very differently than people do.
