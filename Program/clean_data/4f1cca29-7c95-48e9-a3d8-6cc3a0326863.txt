Potatoes are notoriously easy to grow, but you don't need a huge backyard plot to grow your own. All you really need are some seed potatoes, some potting soil, and a large burlap or sturdy plastic sack to dump the soil into. Even urban gardeners with little more than a balcony for outdoor space can have fresh, home-grown potatoes by the time fall rolls around.

Over at Food52, Amy Pennington explains that all you have to do to grow potatoes in a bag is pick a nice sturdy bag (she used a large biodegradable plastic sack, but suggested a used coffee sack will do just fine), some quick-growing organic seed potatoes, and some potting soil. Put the sack into a large storage container, pot, or other easily handled container, fill the sack with the soil, cut the potatoes into sections, plant plant your potatoes, and wait. Best of all, they don't take much additional care, aside from light watering and some extra soil midway through the summer. We're oversimplifying a bit, so make sure to hit the link below for full instructions and a photo walkthrough.
