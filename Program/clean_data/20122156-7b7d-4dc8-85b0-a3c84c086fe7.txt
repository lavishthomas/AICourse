LONDON — Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting a third child, who would be fifth in line to the British throne, Kensington Palace announced Monday.

The announcement came four days after the 20th anniversary of the death of Prince William’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, in a Paris car crash, an event that jolted — but also helped to modernize — the monarchy.

William and Catherine, known as Kate, in many ways have — or are least have projected — a more modern relationship than did their predecessors. Both 35, they met as undergraduates at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and dated for many years before marrying, in contrast with Diana, who had seen Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, only 13 times before their marriage in 1981.

While not the first commoner to marry a royal, Kate has distinctly middle-class roots; her parents started a successful mail-order company for party supplies.
