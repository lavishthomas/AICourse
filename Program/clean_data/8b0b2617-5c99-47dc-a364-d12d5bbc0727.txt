This will not only make you feel better, and make you look better, but help you to get through the day. Research has proven that exercising regularly helps you feel better because endorphins released by the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus during exercise produce a feeling of happiness and well being. Walking is a great exercise. Walk to work or school if you can. If you can't walk the whole way, try parking farther away from your destination so you can walk a least part of the way. You can get of the bus or train a stop earlier if you don't drive.
