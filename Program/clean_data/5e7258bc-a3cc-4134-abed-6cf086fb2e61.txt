One of the easiest, tastiest sheet pan chicken dinners picks up big flavor from a couple of basics in your spice cabinet and takes your tastebuds on a trip to Greece. Inspired by souvlaki — the traditional skewered chicken highlighted with lemon, sweet herbs, and garlic — juicy chicken thighs are infused with the same classic flavors and get cooked until the skin is irresistibly crisp. Partner with crispy red potatoes and sweet, tender bell peppers for a weeknight dinner ready in 30 minutes.

Your Grocery Store Butcher Is the Key to Faster-Cooking Crispy Chicken Thighs

In my dream world, boneless, skin-on chicken thighs are an option in the meat case. But until that time comes, I rely on my grocery store butcher for a helping hand. Removing the bones from a package of chicken thighs is just one of the many things they will do for you, at no extra charge. You can certainly debone the pieces yourself at home, but when the clock is ticking, it's worth it to ask for help at the store.
