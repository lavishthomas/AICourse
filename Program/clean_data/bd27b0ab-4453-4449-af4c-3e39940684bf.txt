The method for testing how well we are able to see without the help of glasses hasn't changed a great deal in over a century.

It follows a basic principle: read from rows of gradually shrinking letters until you're unable to distinguish the shapes any more. From this, opthalmologists can determine people's clarity of vision.

The most well known test is the Snellen chart. It was introduced around the same time as a rival test called the Monoyer chart.

Named after its creator Ferdinand Monoyer, the Monoyer chart was designed more than 100 years ago and was the first eye test to use a decimal system.

Today, on what would be Monoyer's 181st birthday, he has been honoured with a Google Doodle.
