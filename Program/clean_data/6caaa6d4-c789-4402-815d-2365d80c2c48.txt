Crush biscuits and combine with butter. Press into pan lined with aluminum foil. Combine frozen blueberries, 3 tablespoons sugar and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in a bowl. Microwave for 2 minutes. Add 2/3 teaspoon powdered gelatin and mix well. Set aside.

In a bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, yogurt, half the amount of heavy cream, 3 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Mix well until smooth.

Heat the rest of the cream in the microwave until just before boiling. Add 2/3 teaspoon powdered gelatin to combine. Add this to the cream cheese mixture and mix until smooth.

Divide the mixture evenly into three separate bowls. Add all the berries and half the blueberry mixture liquid into one bowl. Pour in the rest of the liquid into the second bowl. Leave the last bowl as is.
