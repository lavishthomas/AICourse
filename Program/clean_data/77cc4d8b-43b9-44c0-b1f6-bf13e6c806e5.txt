It’s hard to improve on an onion ring, but I dare say the folks at Tastemade have done just that. Instead of dipping the allium loops in a batter and then frying them, they’ve gone low-carb (and high-taste) by wrapping them in strips of tasty bacon and baking them.

Watch the above video for all the details—including how to whip up a tasty dipping sauce—but this two-ingredient appetizer (or side) is pretty simple to assemble. Just slice an onion into rings, wrap the rings in bacon, and secure the pork in place with a toothpick. (Tastemade also brushes theirs with a teriyaki sauce, but I don’t think you necessarily need to.) Bake the rings at 300℉ for half an hour, remove the toothpicks, and enjoy.
