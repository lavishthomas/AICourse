If you've ever paid money for something and then found out others have gotten the same thing for free, you've probably kicked yourself. We want to know: what items do people typically spend money on without realizing they can get them for free?

Here's an example. I currently have about five physical magazine subscriptions, including one to the pricey New Yorker. I found them on a freebie site, they cost me nothing, and I've been doing this for years. What else do people spend money on that they can get for free?

We're not really looking for obvious answers, like water. Most people know they can get water without paying for it, they just choose to spend money on it, anyway. We're mostly looking for items people don't realize are often free. Format your answer like this, please:

Name of the item

Where you can get it for free

What you have to do to get it for free
