The water from a can of chickpeas makes a great egg substitute for baked goods and pancakes, but you can also use it in other tasty items like cocktails. Here’s how.



If you don’t eat eggs, or the idea of adding a raw egg to a drink makes you gag, swap in chickpea water (also known as aquafaba) for an egg-less option without losing the frothy texture. Substitute ¾ oz of chickpea water for a medium egg white in your cocktail recipe, then mix the drink as normal. This switch works best for drinks that are less delicate in flavor, like those with stronger tasting booze or other ingredients like simple syrup or citrus, since the chickpea flavor can come through a bit otherwise.
