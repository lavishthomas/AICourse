Pop-up headlights are gone and they’re not coming back. At least, not until they become so uncool that they get cool again. Fashion is cyclical after all, isn’t it? Anyway if you don’t want to wait for flappy-eye lights to return in earnest, here’s what they look like on some of day’s most important sports cars.

The British video listicle kings at CarThrottle have taken the time to artfully render pop-up headlights onto the Nissan 370Z, Porsche Cayman, BMW 6-Series, C7 Corvette, Lamborghini Huracan, Toyota GT86, NSX, Ferrari 488 GTB, Lotus Evora, and new Miata from older cars from each of these respective manufacturers.

The results are, actually, not bad? Alright the BMW looks unbelievably bad but they might be on to something with that Ferrari. And the bubble-pod Porsche popups were such gems!
