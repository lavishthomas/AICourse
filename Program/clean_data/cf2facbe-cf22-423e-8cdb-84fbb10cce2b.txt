LOVE is for the way I look at mushrooms, goat cheese, spinach, and light creamy-sauce-coated pasta with a generous crackle of pepper over the top.

And luhhhhve is for the way I eat it all. ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ <– just to make sure you’re getting where I’m going here.

HOW TO MAKE OUR MUSHROOM PASTA (1 MIN):

In order to really fill out the picture on this heavenly date night mushroom pasta with goat cheese, you need to know this about us: we are pretty traditional in our marriage/home owner roles.

Bjork does outside stuff like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn, and I do the inside stuff like cooking and eating small bites of leftovers out of the fridge. You know, the important stuff.

So I’m not even exaggerating when I say that when Bjork offered to make dinner a few nights ago, it moved his total of Husband-Cooked-Dinners in the lifetime of our marriage to a grand total of 3. One, two, three. We’ve been married for almost six years. OKAY THEN.

“Date night,” we called it. And as it turns out, Bjork actually knows how to cook with the help of a few recipe tutorials, and I actually can and will shovel snow at neck-breaking speed (MY NECK THO), and most importantly: we both die for pasta with goat cheese and mushrooms.

It’s only fair to name this recipe Date Night Mushroom Pasta in honor of how the recipe came into my life.

AND because making and eating this just feels super romantic, maybe because of the white wine, or the earthy textures and colors, or the incredible smells that take over the kitchen when you toss the handful of garlic into the butter and wine, or probably just because I have unnaturally strong feelings of attraction towards melty hunks of goat cheese.

Just let love into your life right now, okay?
