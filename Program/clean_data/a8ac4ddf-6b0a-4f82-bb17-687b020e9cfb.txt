With the holidays coming up, many of us are meeting relatives from our extended family. When they explain how they're related, some of the terms are confusing. This chart gives you an easy guide.

Flowing Data puts it all together. They explain how the chart works:

Figure out the common ancestor between two relatives. Then select the relationship of the first relative to the common ancestor in the top row. Move down to the row that corresponds to the relationship of the second person to the common ancestor. The result is the relationship of the second person to the first.

If you've got a big crowd at Thanksgiving, keep this on hand for reference.

Update: Some people were having trouble reading Flowing Data's chart, but Platypus Man shared a much simpler oneâ€”so we've replaced it with his easier-to-read version. You can still check out Flowing Data's chart below.
