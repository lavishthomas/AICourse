If you're still deciding which vegetables to grow in your garden, this guide from Bottom Line can help. It points out the easy-to-grow vegetables that may save you the most money.

Skip the artichokes and cauliflower, the article suggests, because they're more difficult to grow. Onions and potatoes also won't save you a ton of money versus buying at the store. On the other hand, good values for your gardening efforts include: salad greens (save about $300 for five months' worth of daily salads) and heirloom cherry tomatoes (even better money savers than larger tomatoes, thanks to the longer growing season and bountiful crop).

Of course, money isn't the only consideration for your garden. If you enjoy a good beefsteak tomato or eat a lot of potatoes, no reason you can't grow them as well. For a starter, budget garden, though, this is a good list to consult.
