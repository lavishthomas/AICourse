Your well-being is how comfortable, healthy, and happy you are, so it's important to maintain it. According to the nationwide polls from Gallup and Healthways, these are the states with the highest and lowest well-being index scores.

After a massive poll spanning from January to December last year, each U.S. state was given an index score between 0 and 100 representing the general well-being of the state's population. The score is based on five different metrics including a resident's sense of purpose, their social lives, their financial security, their feeling of community, and their physical health. All things that are important when it comes to maintaining your happiness. Here is how the top five states scored (with 0 representing the lowest possible well-being and 100 representing the highest possible well-being):

Alaska: 64.7 Hawaii: 64.5 South Dakota: 64.3 Wyoming: 63.9 Montana: 63.7

Apparently it's nice to be outside the contiguous United States. The bottom five from best to worst are Mississippi, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and lastly, West Virginia. Of course, all of this information should be taken with a grain of salt. Just because you live in a state with a low index score doesn't mean you're unhappy. But if you are feeling a little down and out, a change of scenery to one of the top states might help. No poll, no matter how big, can capture an individual's experience in certain places, but there must be a reason why so many people are happy in these places.
