I'm about to hire 1 remote worker / freelancer working out of Barcelona, Spain (US Citizen) and another working out of India (Indian Citizen). I previously hired a remote worker out of Ukraine and after he completed a small job, found out that I couldn't pay him through paypal. Ukraine has some laws that make it difficult. So the only way was to open an UpWork account and grant him a private gig and then pay him through them. UpWork charges the client (me) 10% or 20% which is ugly. So I would like to know how you pay your remote workers as freelance contractors, if you are in a situation similar to mine, without ending up having to eat expensive fees, or violating any US or remote workers' country's tax laws. Costs, Fees, reliability #s would be great! [P.S. I'm based in San Francisco, California]
