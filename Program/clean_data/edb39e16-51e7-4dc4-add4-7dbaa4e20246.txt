HOUSTON — Michael Conforto, the Mets’ lone All-Star this season, will have shoulder surgery in the coming week, John Ricco, the team’s assistant general manager, said Saturday before the Mets’ doubleheader against the Astros. Conforto dislocated his left shoulder on a swing in an Aug. 24 game.

A magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed that Conforto also tore the posterior capsule in his shoulder. Ricco said the surgery to repair the capsule would be performed in Los Angeles.

“Until he has the surgery, I don’t think we’re going to be ready to put a time frame on it,” Ricco said. “It’s going to be a considerable rehab.”

The Mets lost the first game of the doubleheader, 12-8, as Matt Harvey, returning after two and a half months away because of a shoulder injury, allowed seven runs on eight hits over two innings, the shortest outing of his career. In the day’s second game, a 4-1 Astros win, outfielder Nori Aoki went 1 for 5 in his debut with the Mets. Infielder Wilmer Flores suffered a broken nose, according to the Mets’ initial diagnosis, after fouling a ball off his face.

The Mets signed Aoki, who is from Japan and is in his sixth major league season, to a prorated major league minimum salary.
