Mars in Libra

Mars in Libra natives often reflect about things before they act. Decisiveness is not their strong point, but they do, eventually, get things done. Many people with this position procrastinate, generally because they feel the need to weigh all of the alternatives before taking action.

Life isn’t always fair, as Mars in Scorpio would say, but Mars in Libra will seldom accept this notion. These natives can easily get caught up in defending themselves and others. Although their overall goal is to live peacefully, they stir others up with their desire to balance everything. Still, they always play innocent when they are challenged, and can generally charm the birds out of the trees to win your favor. Passive-aggressiveness is practically the hallmark of this position. They don’t want to look like they are ever being mean or unfair, but aggression has to go somewhere! Too often, this results in sneaky behavior and subterfuge. On the other hand, some Mars in Libra people turn the Mars energy into action, and they fight for Libran justice and fairness in the world.

On the up side, Mars in Libra people are adept at predicting when problems and discord will occur well in advance. They know how to compromise and are excellent at conflict management.

Mars in Scorpio

Mars in Scorpio natives love to challenge themselves to do the impossible. They throw themselves into what they decide to do with concentrated energy and awesome willpower.

These people make formidable opponents, although often quietly so. They keep their cool and their equilibrium on the surface. Below the surface may be another story, and they are unlikely to easily let you in. Mars in Scorpio has the potential to exploit othersthese people see through others, and rely heavily on their gut feelings.

The sexual stamina of this position is thought to be the strongest of all the positions of Mars. Sometimes, Mars in Scorpio people are attracted to taboos, and their fantasies may involve blowing the taboos to smithereens! They enjoy scenarios in which the “other” is giving in to them, wants them completely, and will do absolutely anything for them. And, their sexual appeal is strong enough that they generally do get what they want.

They find it difficult to share their partners, though they will likely never admit this. In stark contrast to Mars in Libra, who is most comfortable with the middle ground, Mars in Scorpio has a black-or-white philosophy of life. These are the people who say, “Just choose!” They really are not comfortable with compromisewhat kind of satisfaction could you possibly get from compromise? Real living, to Mars in Scorpio, is all about accepting challenges and making changes.

These people constantly test themselves, and, often, others. They make all kinds of rules and goals, just for the personal satisfaction that comes from achieving or mastering them. Their survival instincts are strong, and they embrace their own animal nature when they are all alone with themselves, without guilt.

These people have a provocative quality to them. This quality is usually most evident in youth, though it is often carried over into adulthood in more subtle, controlled ways.

Mars in Scorpio natives who have low self-esteem can become mighty twisted. Instead of beating themselves up, they turn self-loathing outward, and end up manipulating others and feeling resentful.

While Mars in Libra is constantly striving to bring fairness to the world, Mars in Scorpio knows that life simply isn’t fair.

Mars in Sagittarius

When Mars in Sagittarius people get angry, they feel like running. They have to do something–not about it, but something else altogether. They don’t have a lot of patience to wait things out. This is where the restless and adventurous nature of Sagittarius comes in. People with this position of Mars should seriously consider physical activity as the best means of anger management, if they don’t already (naturally) do so.

People with Mars in Sagittarius generally have a number of projects going at once. They are not known for their follow-through, however! They start up new projects, however, with admirable gusto. Their vision and optimism can get in the way of completing what they start–they want to do so much, and they trash things too easily when a new idea takes hold.

Most of the time, Mars in Sagittarius is playful and fun-loving. They love friendly debates, although they can go to extremes. Some take it personally when you don’t agree with them–why wouldn’t you agree, after all? Well, for one, you might (especially if you have planets in Virgo or Gemini) find plenty of holes in their arguments. The thing is, more often than not, they haven’t thought things through, yet they’re very passionate about what they believe in. Mars in Sagittarius loves to “wing it”.

Mars in Sagittarius people see themselves as warm-blooded folk. They are, but they sometimes run roughshod over others’ feelings during their more passionate debates. They can be blunt with people, although if they have a more tactful Mercury placement, this quality will be subdued. Their direct, blunt approach is most obvious in bed. They’re passionate lovers and are turned on by open-mindedness and good humor. But, they are not usually patient when sex gets too intricate or serious.

Mars in Sagittarius can be a little hard to understand. Sometimes they seem to be the most easy-going of people–they love a good joke and a good time. Other times they are on fire–intense and impassioned about something or other. They abhor anything that fences them in. They need to feel like they have space. They’re the ones who will run away when things get too serious or dull. They’ll likely be back soon–it’s just that they need to feel free for a while or they go batty.

When these people argue, they can too easily pick up a moralistic stance that drives everyone around them crazy. More likely than not, however, they jump off their high horse sooner than later, and get back to having fun.

Mars in Sagittarius is used to getting their way and persuading others to believe what they believe in. Every now and again, they face the few that don’t quite buy their grand theories, or, worse yet, poke holes in their plans. This is when these normally fun-loving people get frustrated. In fact, they take it personally when others don’t agree with their philosophies.

Mars in Capricorn

With fiery Mars in the more orderly sign of Capricorn, natives with this position have a subdued and controlled style of approaching life. Most don’t come across as particularly enthusiastic; rather, theirs is a low-key but determined energy.

Mars in Capricorn natives like to be on top of things. They are generally goal-oriented and focused people who are not afraid of hard work. Most are achievers by nature, and many possess well-defined ambitionswell-defined to themselves more than anything. They’re not particularly flashy people, but their drive to succeed and to make their lives secure is strong, even if it’s not right out there for the world to see.

Anger is expressed in a rather cool, level-headed way with this position of Mars. Self-control is strong when it comes to expressing anger, drive, energy, and sexuality. Capricorn is a sign that detests waste of any kind. It also fears disorderliness and “letting go”. With Mars in Capricorn, there is generally a powerful need to stay in control.

This is not to say that natives of this position are cold in any sense of the word. Their desires are strong, but they are often centered around the physical and material worldall that can be seen and held. With Mars in an Earth sign, sensuality is expressed in an earthy way. However, unlike Mars in Taurus, for example, (another earth sign), Mars in Capricorn is not self-indulgent by nature. These people are usually quite disciplined. Capricorn possesses the ability to plan for the future–something that many other signs have difficulty doing.

Mars in Capricorn natives are working toward realistic and attainable goals. They are productive people who get off when they see tangible results from their efforts.

Many natives with this position are a little hard on themselves, and sometimes others. They usually can be relied upon because they have an innate sense of responsibility to both themselves and to those they care about. Most of them are very hard-working, and one of their strategies for anger management is to throw themselves even more energetically into their work!

Mars in Aquarius

It can be a little difficult to understand exactly what makes a Mars in Aquarius native tick. And that’s absolutely fine with themthey enjoy surprising people. The tried-and-true methods of getting things done are far too boring for those born with Mars in this unique and original sign. Mars in Aquarius natives often have a rather original view of the world as well.

These natives are generally quite proud of their independence. They are not easily pushed around with Mars in this fixed sign. Because Aquarius is progressive and open-minded when it comes to the world at large, it can be surprising that on a personal level, Mars in Aquarius natives can be quite obstinate. If they feel boxed in, they are quite likely to rebel. If you’ve discovered a pattern to their ways, they’ll make sure they aren’t so predictable the next time around. Being seen as “normal” simply won’t do!

With Mars, the planet of energy and drive, in an Air sign, these individuals get off on mental and intellectual pursuits. Aquarius is a somewhat scattered sign, even though it’s persevering in the long haul. If there’s a method to their madness, it isn’t always easy to see. Projects are taken on with a shotgun-style approach with this position of Mars.

Mars in Air signs are generally quite clever at getting what they want; in Aquarius, they are particularly adept at getting their way. While this is not an overtly aggressive position of Mars (Aquarius has a manner that is far too detached to come across too forcefully), it is very willful. Combine willfulness with the cleverness of an Air sign, and you have a person who is quite creative about getting what they want–which generally is getting their way! Unlike with Mars in Aries or Leo natives, for example, you won’t always know you’re being dominated by a Mars in Aquarius native!

One of the most pleasant characteristics of Mars in Aquarius natives is their willingness to let others be. They place a lot of value in freedom and individualitytheirs and yours. They need space to be themselves and plenty of room to breathe. Generally not the touchy-feely types, these natives often laugh at sentimentality and tradition. In personal relationships, their approach to intimacy is definitely on the detached side, which can be baffling and frustrating to more personal and affectionate personalities.

Of all the personal planets in the sign of Aquarius, Mars placed here can show the strongest “reformer” streak. The Aquarian ideal of equality works big time with this position, and the desire to push their agenda on others (usually in creative, rather than aggressive, ways) runs high. Obstinacy and a superiority complex are this position’s least desirable traits; openness to new ways of doing things (as long as they’re not forced upon them) is where they shine.

Mars in Pisces

Mild-tempered and gentle, these guys and gals move through life in a manner that can hardly be considered direct. Mars is the planet of action and assertion, and Pisces is a passive sign that rarely asserts itself in a direct fashion. So the placement of Mars in Pisces is an unusual combination. Sometimes prone to feelings of guilt about their anger, and difficulties with asserting themselves, Mars in Pisces individuals seem to “go with the flow”. This is certainly not a very active position for Mars, and natives will often let life “happen” instead of trying to control their life direction. This is a charming position, as individuals with Mars in Pisces don’t appear like they are capable of harming a fly. However, those that don’t find creative expression for this energy can stir up a storm through indirect aggression.

Mars in Pisces people are not averse to playing games to get what they want, although even they don’t always know exactly what they do want! Their desires are changeable and moody, and it’s hard to really know where these natives stand on any particular issue. Alternatively, some Mars in Pisces people do take a stand on issues that are Piscean in nature, making compassion and love their mission.

Energy levels fluctuate a lot, coming in bursts of activity followed by inertia. Because it can be difficult to align this ebbing and flowing of energy in the day-to-day world as it is, finding a job that supports this may be tough. The happiest Mars in Pisces individuals are those that have a creative outlet that allow them to express their desires of the moment, their compassion–and even their angerfreely and imaginatively. An example of Mars in Pisces is Bono, lead singer of U2, who seems to have found the perfect outlet for his creativity through his music, and as a spokesperson for love and compassion.
