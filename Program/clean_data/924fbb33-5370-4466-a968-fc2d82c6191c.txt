Few subjects invite as much heated discussion as “how to cook a steak.” Not only do methods vary with heat and equipment, but there is literally an entire cow’s worth of cuts to choose from. As such, some home cooks may find it daunting, but not any longer, for Serious Eats has a definitive guide to steak.



This thing is amazing, and the interactive guide could not be easier to use. Simply click on your cut or cooking method of choice, and get ready to get hit in the face with all the steak info you could possibly need.

For example, if you click on the delicious looking porterhouse on the left, a description of the “two-in-one” steak comes up, along with heat source suggestions, a little diagram showing you exactly where on the cow it came from, and every porterhouse recipe Serious Eats has ever published. I could prattle on and on about how amazing of a resource this is, but you should click over to Serious Eats and see for yourself.
