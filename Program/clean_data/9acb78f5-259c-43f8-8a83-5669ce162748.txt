Running shoes are made so they fit snuggly and comfortably around your feet, but the way you lace them up changes how they really fit. Blogger KatieRUNSthis shows off a few different lacing techniques that can help when your shoe feels a bit too tight, your heel is slipping, and more.

The basic idea here is that if your shoes are uncomfortable you might just need to lace them differently. For example, if your shoe feels a little too tight, she shares this lacing technique:

To give your shoe an overall roomier feel, try the parallel lacing technique. To start, lace the first tow eyelets near the toe of the shoe. On one side, pull the lace up through the first eyelet and then straight across the shoe and into the eyelet directly across from it. On the other side, skip the first eyelet and pull the lace up through the second eyelet and then lace it into the eyelet straight across from it. Repeat this skipping an eyelet and lacing across pattern until the shoe is laced to the top. This lacing technique is a little tricky, so here is a link to a video that might help.

It's worth trying out a new lacing technique before you head to the store for new kicks. Head over to KatieRUNSthis for techniques to correct for high instep, wide forefoot, narrow foot, heel slipping, and black toenails.
