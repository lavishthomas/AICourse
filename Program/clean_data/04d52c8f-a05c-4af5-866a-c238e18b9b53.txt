Among the classification of threatened species, the category Critically Endangered corresponds to the greatest risk. In India, there are 70+ critically endangered animals and 60+ critically endangered plants. 300+ animals fall under the category of endangered while 140+ plants fall under the category of endangered. This post is a detailed list of the critically endangered animal species in India. These include mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, fishes, corals and so on.

When is a species considered critically endangered?

Critically endangered is the highest risk category assigned by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List to wild species. There are five quantitative criteria to determine whether a taxon is threatened. A taxon is critically endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the following criteria:

Populations have declined or will decrease, by greater than 80% over the last 10 years or three generations. Have a restricted geographical range. Small population size of less than 250 individuals and continuing decline at 25% in 3 years or one generation. Very small or restricted population of fewer than 50 mature individuals. High probability of extinction in the wild.

Critically Endangered Animal Species of India

The Critically Endangered list includes 10 mammals, 15 birds, 6 reptiles, 19 species of amphibians, 14 fishes etc.

Critically endangered birds in India under a different classification can be grouped as:

Migratory Wetland Species – Baer’s Pochard (Aythya baeri), Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus) Non-migratory Wetland Species – White-bellied Heron (Ardea insignis) Grassland Species – Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps), Jerdon’s Courser(Rhinoptilus bitorquatus), Sociable Lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) Forest Species – Forest Owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti) Scavengers – Indian Vulture (Gyps indicus), Red-headed Vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), Slender-billed Vulture (Gyps tenuirostris), White-backed Vulture (Gyps bengalensis). Practically extinct – Himalayan Quail (Ophrysia superciliosa), Pink-headed Duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea)

Extra note : In the lower risk categories, the agency included 14 bird species as Endangered and 51 as vulnerable ones. In the latest list, two birds – the River Lapwing and River Tern – that were listed as species of least concern have been registered as near threatened. A third bird, the long-tailed duck, which has been sighted in India on a few occasions, has moved from ‘least concern’ to ‘vulnerable’ on the red list.
