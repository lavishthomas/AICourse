Three months ago, I worked in San Francisco as a marketing leader for a unicorn startup. I earned a salary that let me do, eat, and buy whatever I wanted. Now, I live and work from a beach in Belize, earn half of what I used to, and couldn’t be happier.

Deciding It Was Time After spending 12 years on a career path that just wasn’t the dream I’d imagined it would be when I started out on it, I knew it was time to try something else. I also knew that just making small changes probably wouldn’t cut it–and that felt liberating. It opened up possibilities I hadn’t considered.

I feel more balanced, stress-free, and happy than I ever did during the decade I was trying to push my way to the top. But before I could start working from paradise, I needed to move fast and make some tough choices. Here’s how I managed to set up a sustainable business as an independent worker based overseas in just two months’ time. Month 1: Lay The Foundation For Your Remote Business Decide your niche business, and market it correctly. First, decide what your remote online business will be and who your target audience is–hopefully you’ll have a sense of this already based on your current skills and the role you’re leaving behind.
