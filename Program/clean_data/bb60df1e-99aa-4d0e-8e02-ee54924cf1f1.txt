Things such as smoking, drinking alcohol and eating unhealthy (junk) foods can speed up the aging process and also that can put us on a fast track to developing a disease. Being healthy, and most importantly, feeding ourselves healthy food, slows down the aging process so we can enjoy every day to the fullest. The smoothie below is an excellent blend of ingredients such as spring greens, red grapes, banana, strawberry, almonds. All of those ingredients are wealthy with many nutrients including Vitamin C, Vitamin E. Vitamin C is proven to mop up the free radicals that trigger wrinkling, sagging, and other aging changes. Vitamin C also helps smooth and firm skin and fade brown spots. While on the other side Vitamin E eases dryness and bolsters skin’s UV defense(1).
