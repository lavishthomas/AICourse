In trying to keep up with emissions and fuel efficiency laws, the fuel system used in modern cars has changed a lot over the years. The 1990 Subaru Justy was the last car sold in the United States to have a carburetor; the following model year, the Justy had fuel injection. But fuel injection has been around since the 1950s, and electronic fuel injection was used widely on European cars starting around 1980. Now, all cars sold in the United States have fuel injection systems.

In this article, we'll learn how the fuel gets into the cylinder of the engiÂ­ne, and what terms like "multi-port fuel injection" and "throttle body fuel injection" mean.
