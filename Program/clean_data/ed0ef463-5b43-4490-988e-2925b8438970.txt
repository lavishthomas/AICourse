With Adobe Illustrator CC’s Blend tool, it’s easy to turn two simple lines into a minimalistic yet intricate vector illustration.

I was inspired by Italian artist Andrea Minini, who can make a menagerie with just a few lines. See his work in “Andrea Minini’s Artful Blending.”



Step 1: Begin by drawing a petal that consists of two parts. From Illustrator's Toolbar, select the Pen tool and draw two base lines. We’ll use these lines to make a blend.
