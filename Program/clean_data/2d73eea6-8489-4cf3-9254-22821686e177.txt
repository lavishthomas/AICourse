Just how adorable are these handmade ceramics? Warsaw, Poland-based artist Marta Turowska creates these whimsical bowls and plates that feature our favorite animals like cats, hedgehogs and whales. Her works are all made completely by hand on a potter’s wheel and then the animals’ tiny features are painted on.

“I am passionate for clay, glazes and paints,” she states. “Each mug, salter or plater coming out of my workshop has its own story, different inspiration. Each of my items has its individual character that I want to share with their future owners. At the start of XXth century, writer Nadezhda Mandelstam announced the beginning of an era of ugly things. I would love to bring back the beauty in everyday things, soap dishes, sugar-bowls, butter churns.” More info: Etsy
