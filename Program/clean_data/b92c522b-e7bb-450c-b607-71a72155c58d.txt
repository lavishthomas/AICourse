"I'm allergic to a lot of makeup but their stuff is so good for highly sensitive skin. There were times my eyes would swell shut with expensive mascaras, so I was hesitant to try anything, but I gave theirs a go and have now been a member of their VIP club for five-plus years. It's pricey, but 50% off as a VIP and a gift box every second month with a lot of products are so worth it. The mascara stays on all day and washes off instantly in the shower. Their balm primer is essential for large pores and their double-ended eyeliner pen makes cat eyes so easy. And no swelling, rashes, bumps — nothing!" —reijiliew
