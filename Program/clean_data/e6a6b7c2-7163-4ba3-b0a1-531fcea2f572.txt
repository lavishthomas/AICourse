iOS/Web: Yummly returns search results based on dietary restrictions and preferences. It also makes recipe suggestions based on things like location, weather, time, and your grocery list.

You may already know that with Yummly, you can search by ingredients to find new recipes, but that's not what makes it special. Yummly is best known for its customization and intelligent suggestions. When you make a profile, you can set your cooking skill level, and personalize your search results and suggestions with dietary restrictions (like "pescetarian" or food allergies). It also makes suggestions based on your grocery list, and, with the newest iOS update, weather, location, and time as well.
