If you see an ingredient called dimethicone* in your hair products, chances are that it's drying your hair out over time. The silicone coats your hair, giving it that nice slippery feeling, but it also prevents moisture and oils from penetrating your hair.

*Dimethicone copolyl and PEG modified dimethicone are water-soluble silicones, which means they wash out with water and do not coat the hair as long as you rinse out thoroughly.
