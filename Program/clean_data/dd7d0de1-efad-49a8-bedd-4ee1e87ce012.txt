Michael Sheen is to give up acting at the height of his career to fight the rise of the far-right populism.

The Frost/Nixon star said he would be leaving Hollywood to order to commit himself to political activism and fight "demagogic, fascistic" politics that he says has engulfed the West over recent years.

"In the same way as the Nazis had to be stopped in Germany in the Thirties, this thing that is on the rise has to be stopped," he told The Times.

Sheen added that the election of Donald Trump had compelled him to take action. "It's not going to look like this in 10 years' time. Everything has shifted. The dice are being rolled again,‚Äù he said.

The actor is to return to Port Talbot in south Wales to co-ordinate the activities and says the support of his home town for Brexit is one of the reasons he has decided to begin his activism back where he began.
