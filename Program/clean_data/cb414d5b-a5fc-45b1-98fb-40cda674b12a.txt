No matter what stage you’re at in the entrepreneur journey, whether you just launched your first startup or have started several successful businesses, you can always use the advice of people who have "been there, done that.'’ What better way to get advice then from the pages of a book?

I've been lucky enough to be successful in my life. But it didn't happen overnight and I didn't do it myself. I've had the great advice from many entrepreneurs before me who have had success. I like to refer to these nuggets of success as the habits of unicorn entrepreneurs. Within these top books for entrepreneurs I learned how to do a lot of what I do and the mentality behind what I do. This has shaped me and can shape you into who you can become.

While it was certainly no easy task, I’ve complied 25 books that should be read and used as a guide for an entrepreneur’s success.
