Alta Motorcycles has two solid options for those just entering the market. The Redshift SM, pictured here, has an output of 40 hp and 120 ft.-lb. of torque. Priced at $15,495, the Redshift SM has a top speed of 80 mph and charges in six hours from a level 2 charger. The SM is a bit limited when it comes to range at just 50 miles, but it's packed with enough power for those looking for a city bike.

For anyone looking to go electric for an off-road experience, Alta also offers its Redshift MX, pictured here. Like the SM, it also has an output of 40 hp and 120 ft.-lb. of torque. The MX is a bit cheaper at $14,995, but you'll be compromising more with a top speed of 65 mph. Alta says the MX has a range anywhere between 1-4 hours, depending on factors like environment and speed. Both the SM and MX can be reserved online with a $100 deposit. Deliveries for the SM are scheduled to begin in February. The MX will be delivered between now and February 1, depending on when you place your order. Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, two of the original co-founders of Tesla, invested in Alta Motorcycles.

If you're looking for an option with some extra juice, Victory Motorcycles' Empulse TT has an output of 54 hp and 61 ft-lb of torque. The Empulse TT can reach 110 mph easily, a spokesperson for Victory Motorcycles told Business Insider. It has a range of 100 miles, so you can have it out for longer than the Redshift SM. The $19,999 motorcycle can fully charge in roughly four hours on a level 2 charger and can be bought at a local Victory Motorcycles dealer.

Zero Motorcycles has a few different options for its electric motorcycle, the Zero SR, so you can customize it based on your driving needs. It offers a solid output of 70 hp and 116 ft.-lb torque. The lowest performance version, the ZF6.5, gets 81 miles on a single charge, but the ZF13.0 offers a range of 161 miles. You can also shell out more for a Power Tank that will increase the range to 202 miles on city streets and 101 miles on a highway. Pricing starts at $10,995 for the option that gets 81 miles on a charge. The version above that costs $14,000. The Zero SR is also a bit more high-tech than the other options we've seen so far. It comes with an LCD screen showing battery charge and speed. It syncs with an app that will track that data, but also allows you to set parameters like the maximum speed you want to go when riding. Zero Motorcycles doesn't say how long it takes the bike to charge, only stating that purchasing its Charge Tank accessory will reduce the charge time to 2-3 hours at standard charging stations. The motorcycle can be purchased at a local dealer.

If you've got a need for speed, your best bet is Lightning Motorcycle's LS 218 that the company claims is the fastest production motorcycle in the world. It packs an insane output of 200 hp with 168 ft.-lbs. of torque. The LS 218 set a world record of 215.907 mph at Bonneville Speedway in Utah in 2011. The motorcycle has an average range of 100 miles on highways. But it's a bit pricier with that kind of speed and power at $38,888. It charges in 2 hours on a level 2 charger. You can order an LS 218 online.

The Energica Ego is another option for those looking for more speed. The Italian superbike gets an output of 136 hp with 195 Nm (roughly 144 ft.-lb.) of torque. The motorcycle has a maximum speed limited at 149 mph and a range of 93 miles. The Ego can charge in 3.5 hours on a level 2 charger, but can charge in 30 minutes on a DC fast charger. The Ego comes with a 4.3-inch color display that monitors the battery and offers short-range Bluetooth connectivity of up to 100 meters (328 feet.) The $34,000 motorcycle will offer cellular connectivity for longer ranges by the end of this year. It also comes with Park Assistant.

Energica also offers a slightly cheaper electric roadster option, the Eva. The biggest difference between the Eva and Ego comes down to power, as the Eva has an output of 95 hp and 170 Nm (125 ft.-lb.) of torque. But even if the Eva doesn't pack the same punch as the Ego, it's still a solid option with a top speed of 124 mph. The roughly $26,500 motorcycle also has a range of up to 124 miles in ECO mode. The Eva can charge fully in 3.5 hours with a standard level 2 outlet.

Johammer, a small engineering company based in Austria, has built a futuristic, electric cruiser dubbed the Johammer J1. The Johammer J1 can drive 200 kilometers (124 miles) on a single charge. The motorcycle has a unique look that speaks to Johammer's engineering eye. The electric motor and controller are integrated into the rear wheel and the frame is designed to better absorb shock. The motorcycle also has a 2.4-inch digital display in its rearview mirrors that shows speed, revs, and warnings. It can reach a top speed of 75 mph and accelerate to 62 mph in 8 seconds. The motorcylce is only available in Europe, but Johammer is looking to expand. The motorcycle starts at €24.900 euros ($26,508). You can also break the payment into €249 ($265) a month over 48 months after putting down a €6,900 ($7,345) deposit.
