You’d think you could just toss some fertilizer on your soil and let the plants do their thing, but taking proper care of your garden so that you actually grow decent vegetables can require a few more steps that beginners might not be aware of. This video from California Gardening takes a look at the ten most common mistakes.

For example, using organic material to fertilize you soil isn’t something that happens instantly; it’ll take months for the material to break down into a form that the plants can use as nutrients. (Synthetic fertilizers work instantly, though). And then different varieties of plants and vegetables will require different sorts of care: over-watering can be particularly bad for onions, edible roots don’t thrive in high nitrogen soil, and not everything will grow well year round.
