If you want to define your top lip with the perfect “cupid’s bow,” start by drawing an “X” as a guideline. This trick will help you get the shape you want with just one extra step at the start.

For that perfect “M” shape (also called a “cupid’s bow,”) on your upper lip, follow these steps:

Use a lip liner pencil to draw a diagonal line from one peak of your cupid’s bow to the bottom of your top lip. Do the same on the other side, crossing the first line to form an “X” shape. Line the rest of your lip as you would normally. Follow the natural shape of your upper lip down from the peaks of your cupid’s bow to the corners of your mouth. Line your bottom lip. Fill in your upper lip with gloss or lipstick at a diagonal, keeping it within the “X” you’ve already drawn. Fill in your bottom lip.

This trick is especially useful if you don’t wear lipstick much and don’t have a routine down. Once you’ve finished applying your lipstick, blot the excess with a tissue. For a step-by-step visual guide, check out the link below.
