Target the Long Run: Every other week, increase your long run by 1.5 miles until you're run/walking 13 to 14 miles. On alternate weeks, keep your long run to no longer than three miles. Your longest long run should fall two weeks before your half-marathon. Plan to take about 15 weeks to prepare for the big day.

Take it Easy: The most common mistake runners make is going out too fast—then crashing and burning. If you've raced a couple of 5Ks, aim to run three to four minutes per mile slower on your long runs and on race day. Otherwise, just make sure you can talk comfortably, and take plenty of walk breaks. This pacing strategy will give you the endurance you need without wiping you out.

Strike a Balance: Keep your weekday runs to no longer than 30 minutes. If your goal race is hilly, do one of those runs on hills. Vary your pace depending on how you feel—but do try to mix in some speed to boost your fitness. Experiment with your run/walk ratio, gradually adding time to the run segment over the course of your training. On nonrunning days, do easy cross-training like walking, swimming, or cycling, or simply rest up.
