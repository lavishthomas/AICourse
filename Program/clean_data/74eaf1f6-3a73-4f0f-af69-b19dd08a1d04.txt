Ceramic artist Brian Giniewski produces delightful earthenware vessels that appear to be oozing thick, colorful drips that are frozen in time. The Philadelphia-based ceramicist achieves the texture of the vases and bowls by applying a gritty, matte slip to each piece which contrasts nicely with a special glossy glaze made to melt into drips during the firing process. Giniewski is currently Kickstarting a move into a new studio space and is offering a variety of unique objects. You can see more of his work on Instagram and in his online shop.
