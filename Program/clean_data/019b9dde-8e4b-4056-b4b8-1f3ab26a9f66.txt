Raising children is a lot of work, so who can blame parents that look for tips and tricks to make it all a little easier? Sadly, not all life hacks are as useful as they seem. Here’s what happens when 25 of the most popular parenting hacks are attempted.

In this video from the Mental Floss YouTube channel, host John Green is back to see which life hacks are actually worth a parent’s time. Some work pretty well, like mess-free finger painting using a plastic bag, storing children’s puzzles in a laundry bag so no pieces get lost, filling a plastic bag with frozen marshmallows for a DIY ice pack, and reversing a crazy straw to make it so a kid can’t pull it out of the cup. Others fail miserably and hysterically, like using WD-40 to remove crayon stains from clothes, using a cookie cutter as a stencil for custom birthday cakes, filling water balloons with a pump soap dispenser, and using a coffee creamer container as snack storage. Of course, you can probably get by without most of these tips as long as you know the important stuff.
