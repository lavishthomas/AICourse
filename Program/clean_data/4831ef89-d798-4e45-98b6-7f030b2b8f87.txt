Just because a character has been around forever doesn’t mean there aren’t new ways to reimagine it. Damon Hellandbrand, a talented artist based in the U.S., has created a series of images that portray the symbols of the zodiac as twisted, surreal creatures straight out of a nightmarish realm.

Hellandbrand does much of his art with various digital illustration programs, but some are born as pencil drawings or watercolors – or “basically whatever medium I’m in the mood for.” He writes that he is inspired by artists like Ralph McQuarrie, Boris Vallejo and Frank Frazetta, and it’s easy to imagine that Guillermo Del Toro might number among his influences as well.

Aries

“I have a fondness for anything fantasy related or anything that doesn’t exist in reality,” Damon Hellandbrand told Bored Panda, “and mythology certainly has that in spades”

Taurus

“I think also because those were some of the first stories I remember as a child in school that they just stuck with me”

Gemini

“I basically took what I knew the signs represented in terms of their name (i.e. Cancer = Crab, Leo = Lion, Pisces = Fish etc). and proceeded to illustrate them as human/animal hybrids”

Cancer

“I did this by doing a black and white pencil drawing on paper and then scanning the illustration into a drawing/painting program called Corel Painter to color and paint”

Leo

“I didn’t do as much research on these symbols as I should have and I’ve gotten a lot of responses as such, so needless to say I’ll be making a few new pieces to redeem myself”
