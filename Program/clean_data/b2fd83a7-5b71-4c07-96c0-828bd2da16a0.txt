Good lighting is one of the most important aspects of any professional production. Unfortunately your budget may not allow for all the expensive equipment required for that perfect look. With that in mind, we created this list of over 100 DIY (“Do It Yourself”) lighting tutorials.

As always, whenever you are dealing with electricity and heat safety always comes first. For your sake and the sake of your crew, never take on one of these projects unless you know what you are doing. Saving a few dollars is not worth causing an injury or worse.
