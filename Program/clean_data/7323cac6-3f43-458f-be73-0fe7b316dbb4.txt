Painting a piece of furniture is one of the easiest ways to transform it into something that looks like new, but you have several choices of type of paint to use. Choosing isn’t as simple as matching a material to a paint type. Here are the pros and cons of three common types.

Joanna Linberg, editor at Sunset Magazine, demonstrates the pros and cons of three types of furniture paint in the video at the link below. If you can’t check out the video, here they are:



Acrylic paint: You can get this paint mixed in any color and the thin paint is easy to use, but it doesn’t cover furniture thoroughly and brush marks are visible even after a few coats. It is best suited for simple furniture.

However, you can’t really get this paint mixed in a custom color so your selection is lower. Ideal for furniture that has a lot of detail.

Besides these pros and cons, if you don’t have much time, spray paint is the fastest to apply and dries relatively quickly.
