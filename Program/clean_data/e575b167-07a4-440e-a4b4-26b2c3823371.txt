Similarly, in Defiance County in northwest Ohio, population 38,158, the unemployment rate rose from 5.3 percent in August 2007 to 5.9 percent in February 2017. The local labor force shrank over this period by 1,379 workers.

In 2016, Defiance became much more Republican than it had been: while voters there had supported Romney over Obama 55.5 to 42.2 percent, they supported Trump over Clinton 63.7 to 29.3 percent.

Compare Luzerne and Defiance counties to the Los Angeles-Glendale-Long Beach metropolitan area. There, not only did the unemployment rate fall from 5.6 percent in July 2007 to 4.8 percent in February 2017, but total employment grew from 4.68 million to 4.84 million.

The greater Los Angeles region — like other densely populated metropolitan areas such as Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and Dallas County in Texas — recovered strongly and swiftly and supported the Democratic Party in Nov. 2016, from candidates for local office to the president.

Trump lost to Clinton in Los Angeles County by 48 points, a substantially larger margin than the 39.5 points by which Romney lost the county to Obama in 2012.

The diverging fortunes of metropolitan counties and virtually all nonmetro regions of the country are graphically displayed in the accompanying chart produced by the Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.

The chart shows that since the bottom of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2009, metropolitan areas have fully bounced back and are now significantly above their pre-recession employment levels. In contrast, employment in non-metro areas remains well below its pre-recession level.

Trump won majorities in counties with populations under one million, and his margin of victory rose as the population numbers got smaller. In counties with fewer than 2,500 people, Trump won 70.6 to 25.1 percent.

From another vantage point, Trump did best in regions where economic growth was the worst — where jobs are disappearing and where middle-aged white men and women are dying at younger ages.

The crucial role of the financial meltdown and its aftermath in shaping regional politics is also on display in the accompanying chart produced by the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan think tank.

More Jobs in the Big City Share of U.S. job creation by size of county in three periods of economic growth. COUNTY POPULATION Less than 100,000 100,000 to 500,000 500,000 to 1m 1m or more 1992 –96 27% 36 21 16 2002 –06 20 39 19 23 2010 –14 9 26 23 41 50% COUNTY POPULATION Less than 100,000 100,000 to 500,000 500,000 to 1 million More than 1 million GROWTH PERIOD 1992–96 27% 36 21 16 2002–06 20 39 19 23 2010–14 9 26 23 41 50%

In the period from 1992 to 1996, communities of 100,000 or less were engines of growth, producing 27 percent of the nation’s new jobs. The large metropolitan areas with populations of over one million produced 16 percent.

By 2010 to 2014, the share of new jobs in the lowest population counties shrank to 9 percent, while the share produced in the largest counties grew from 16 to 41 percent.

Put still another way, counties with populations below one million have seen their share of job creation drop from 84 percent of the national total in 1992-96 to 78 percent in 2002-06 — and then abruptly plummet to 59 percent in 2010-14.

The pattern of net new business creation (new firms minus firms going out of business) reveals an even sharper reversal of fortune. In 1992-96, counties with fewer than 100,000 people produced 32 percent of new enterprises, while the biggest counties produced 13 percent.

By 2010-14, very rural counties saw zero net growth in new firms, while the biggest counties boomed with 58 percent of new firms. All counties with populations under a million created 87 percent of the nation’s new businesses from 1992-1996, but the number was 42 percent in 2010-14.

In other words, the centuries-long shift of economic activity from country and small town areas to populous urban regions has sharply accelerated over the past 10 years. The result is that “America faces a small-county crisis of dire proportions,” as Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings put it, “and a period of opportunity in cities, the bigger the better.”

There is a combination of forces driving these trends, according to Muro, most especially the growing importance of the high tech and digital industries. “Urbanization,” he wrote me,

has become a major trend in the last decade or so, driven by the clustering of workers and firms in larger cities. The increased digitization of the economy has accelerated this dynamic, and ensured that changing skills demands have changed what places are best valued.

By 2015, 74 percent of all high tech jobs were located in the 100 largest counties “where the universities, technology innovation assets, supply chains, STEM workers, and industry clusters on which the sector depends reside,” Muro wrote in a paper in August, 2016 with two Brookings colleagues, David M. Hart and Siddharth Kulkarni.

At the same time, Muro noted by email:

Rural America has been hammered by the end of the immediate post-crisis commodity boom and now there is precious little relief there: Agricultural prices are low, coal prices and automation are hammering coal country, natural gas prices are suffering from glut conditions, and meanwhile, no subdivision of the economy is suffering from more moribund employment growth.

The rural crisis, according to Muro, “isn’t just economic but is now compounded by the rising mortality rates” described in detail by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton.

In their most recent published work, “Mortality and morbidity in the 21st century,” a Brookings paper, Case and Deaton, who teach at Princeton, update their earlier studies to provide

a more complete picture of midlife mortality — by sex and education group, over the full age range of midlife, using shorter age windows, over time, by cause, and by small geographic areas.

The Case-Deaton description of rising midlife mortality — especially an increase of “deaths of despair” from alcohol, opioids and suicide — is, in effect, a demographic portrait of many of Trump’s core supporters: whites with a high school degree or less living in rural to medium-sized towns and cities.

Case and Deaton show that from 1999 to 2015 mortality rates among non-college whites rose in every age group, most especially among younger whites aged 25-34.

The accompanying chart shows the rising “deaths of despair” rates for whites without college degrees, compared to the virtually unchanging rates for whites with degrees.

White ‘Deaths of Despair’ Deaths per 100,000 non-Hispanic whites aged 50 to 54, from suicide, alcohol or other drugs, by education level. Men 200 196 150 Women High school education or less 115 100 Men 50 47 College or more Women 26 ’98 ’00 ’05 ’10 ’15

Case and Deaton found that mortality rates for whites were stable or declining in all counties with populations of one million or more — the counties, in other words, that voted decisively for Clinton. Conversely, white mortality rates rose by roughly one percent a year in all counties of less than a million — the counties that voted for Trump.

Bill Bishop, co-author of the book “The Big Sort” and a founder of The Daily Yonder, makes the case that the political split in America is not an urban-rural divide. Instead, he argues, it is between the largest cities and the rest of America.

In an email, Bishop noted that

outside of cities of a million or more — and really outside of the 56 central city counties of these large metros — Democrats lose.

This applies not only to presidential races, but to the House as well. In a piece for The Daily Yonder, Bishop wrote that “Democrats don’t have a ‘rural problem.’ They have an ‘everywhere-but-big-cities problem’.” He provided data on the pattern of partisan victory in 2014 House races on a scale from super urban to very rural. Democrats won a majority of districts only in the most urban counties, while Republicans won two out of every three in very rural districts.

Bishop argued in his email to me that “the split isn’t just about politics. It’s about lifestyle and identity.” Increasingly, where you live

is tied into lifestyle and lifestyle aligns with politics. Politics, like lifestyle, is one way we construct our identities.

The accelerated shift toward urban prosperity and exurban-to-rural stagnation reinforces polarizing disagreements between city and country on matters ranging from family values to education to child rearing practices to religious faith.

The two maps below show results by county in 1992, when Bill Clinton first won the presidency, and in 2016, when Trump did. The maps demonstrate the strategic hurdles currently confronting both parties. In 1992, Bill Clinton won 1,519 counties to 1,582 carried by George H. W. Bush. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won majorities in 490 counties to Trump victories in 2622. Obama won 875 counties in 2008 and 693 in 2012.
