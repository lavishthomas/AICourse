When the middle-schoolers on the Netflix show “Stranger Things” ride their bikes through the woods around their small town, it’s a clear nod to “E.T.” But those scenes are also reminders of something else: unsupervised childhood.

Set in 1983, “Stranger Things” — spoilers follow — begins with the disappearance of 12-year-old Will Byers and the appearance of a mysterious young girl, Eleven. Will’s friends Mike, Lucas and Dustin team up with Eleven (El for short) to find him and fight a monster that puts the whole town at risk.

In the process, the boys don’t just go on unsupervised bike trips. They also manage to hide El in Mike’s basement for days without his parents finding out. Though the parents are loving and generally responsible, this is the ’80s, and they just aren’t watching their son that closely.

There is only one character who could be called a helicopter parent, and he’s the nightmarish Dr. Martin Brenner, the scientist who raised El. He kept her hidden deep within his lab and forced her to take part in sometimes violent experiments to hone her supernatural powers. After her escape, he sends a small army of G-men to search for her.

The boys have their problems, too. Will disappears after he bikes home from Mike’s house and finds his own home empty. But the kids also manage to help save their town, thanks to El’s special powers.
