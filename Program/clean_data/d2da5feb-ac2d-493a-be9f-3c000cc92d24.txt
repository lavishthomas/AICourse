Today is the 60th birthday of Stephen Fry, a polymath, awards host, quiz show behemoth, writer, actor and the nation's favourite inappropriate uncle.

To mark the occasion, let's take a stroll through 60 of Mr Fry's wisest and wittiest quotes. (Or is it quotations? He'd probably correct us.)

We begin, fittingly enough, with this bon mot...

"I don't need you to remind me of my age, I have a bladder to do that for me."

Sorry, Stephen.
