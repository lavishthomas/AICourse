Danish firm C.F. Møller has won first place in a competition to design an extension and renovation of Vendsyssel Hospital in Hjørring, Denmark. This winning proposal will add 14,000 square meters to the existing structure, incorporating a new treatment center, a ward for mothers and children, and a rooftop children’s playground. The new facilities are arranged around large courtyards, and make use of large windows to display the path of travel through the hospital. This helps make navigating through the large building as easy as possible.

The competition judges stated: “The overall ethos of the design was best of all those received… The secluded outdoor areas on the third floor which have excellent views and plenty of natural sunlight, are convincing features which underpin the desire for the architecture to become part of the healing aspect of patients’ treatment.”

The exterior spaces of the hospital are as devoted to healing as the interior. The hospital’s landscape scheme will include stormwater handling as a part of its planting and paving plan, to help reduce the environmental impact of the design. In addition, the building is expected to receive a certified silver ranking from the Green Building Council Denmark, requiring less than 25 kWh/m2 in terms of energy use.

The Vendsyssel Hospital construction and renovation is expected to be completed by 2019.
