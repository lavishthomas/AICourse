1. Flatten out the sleeve (preferably ironed) on a steady surface.

2. Bend the sleeve upward at the cuff, then curl...

3. ... until it is inside out.

4. Straighten both the bottom and top of the cuff. They should be very neat and without wrinkles.

6. Curl again. Then neaten. Repeat to your preferred height on the arm. (Consider going higher up with this style.)
