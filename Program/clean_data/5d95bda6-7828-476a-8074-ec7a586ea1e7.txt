It was the dead of winter and, like many New Yorkers, Geetika Agrawal wanted to escape. “But I didn’t just want to sit on a beach,” she says. “I wanted a transformational travel experience—something that stimulated the creative side of my brain.”

The young creative director looked high and low for a trip that fit the bill and “settled on four days of acroyoga in the Dominican Republic,” she laughs. “But it definitely didn’t satisfy my urge for an artistic experience.” That’s when she recognized a gap in the travel industry—and the mission to fill it took hold of her.

In November 2015, Agrawal launched Vacation with an Artist (VAWAA), a website that offers short-term apprenticeships with artists, designers, and creatives around the world. Through VAWAA, an art-hungry traveler can book several-day workshops with a street artist in Buenos Aires, an ikebana master in Kyoto, and a bamboo bicycle-maker in Bangalore, among other artisans representing a vast array of mediums.
