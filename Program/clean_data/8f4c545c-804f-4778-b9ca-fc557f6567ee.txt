Your departure for the hospital or birthing center probably won't be as frantic as Hollywood wants you to believe, but it's still a good idea to be prepared. That means having your birth plan finished and your Who to Call list right where your partner can find it. (You have created a birth plan and a Who to Call list, right?) That also means having a bag packed and ready to go several weeks in advance of your due date (yes, weeks — just in case your baby decides to make an unexpectedly early appearance). You certainly don't want to do any last-minute scrambling worthy of a sitcom script (it won't be nearly as funny if it happens in real life).

Labor Gear

Pen and pad, for taking notes

Your birth plan (several copies, so all staff, on all shifts, can get one)

A small basket of goodies for the staff to give along with the birth plan

Your insurance card

Any other hospital paperwork you've filled out

Your cord blood banking kit, if you're banking your baby's cord blood

Stopwatch to time contractions

Massage oils or lotions

Your favorite pillow

If you have long hair, a clip or scrunchie to keep it out of your face

Sugarless candies or lollipops to keep your mouth moist

A tennis ball or plastic rolling pin — both make excellent backrub tools — or an actual massager

Snacks to eat during labor (your own snacks will be limited and must be approved by your practitioner; your partner should pack sandwiches and nutritious nibbles so he or she doesn't have to leave your side to find something to eat)

Diversions for a long labor: music, puzzles, magazines, books, a deck of cards, laptop, handheld electronic games

Any mementos you'll want with you, such as family photos

Your Who to Call list and possibly a prepaid calling card (some hospitals don't allow smartphones)

In addition to your smartphone, a camera and/or video camera, if you have one — even if you don't want to capture your labor and delivery experience, you'll definitely want to capture your first family portrait

Personal Items

Toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash

Hairbrush and comb

All your essential toiletry items (don't forget moisturizer)

Extra-absorbent maxi pads (the hospital will provide some, but you might want to use the brand you're most comfortable with)

Snacks for after delivery — don't count on the hospital or birthing center to provide them in the middle of the night

Champagne or sparkling cider to celebrate with

Shower gel, face wash, shampoo, conditioner, makeup and whatever else it takes to make you feel human again after delivery

A baby care book, like What to Expect the First Year (if you want to lug it and think you'll have a chance to look at it)

A baby book for recording everything (ditto)

Clothing for You and Your Baby

Extra pairs of underwear suitable for wearing with maxi pads (no thongs, in other words) and a nursing bra

Nightgown or PJs, socks and slippers

Comfortable outfit to head home in (remember you'll still look six months pregnant, so plan accordingly)

Going-home outfit for baby (don't forget socks or booties and a receiving blanket, plus extra layers if it's cold). Bring along a few diapers, although the hospital will probably provide them

Other Essentials

Rear-facing infant car seat: When it comes time to take your newborn home, your partner should know how to find it quickly and install it correctly. Better still, install it in advance so you're ready to roll (after you're both checked out by the hospital staff).
