Whether you want to make steak fries, shoestring fries, or classic French fries, this algorithm guides you every step of the way so they turn out perfectly.

Blake Lingle is the cofounder and co-owner of the Boise Fry Company, so he knows a thing or two about fried spuds. The flow chart above, “The Fry Algorithm,” from Lingle’s book Fries!: An Illustrated Guide to the World’s Favorite Food, explains the exact science for frying up some gold. It covers the potato choosing process, how thick to cut them, and how to prepare them so they’re the crispiest, most-flavorful fries you’ve ever had.
