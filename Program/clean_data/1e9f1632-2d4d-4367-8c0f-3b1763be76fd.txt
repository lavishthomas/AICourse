Interior design is widely considered to be a pretty subjective matter. But that’s not to say there’s no distinction between good design and bad design. For instance, if you want a certain room to elicit a certain emotion and it fails to deliver, you’ve designed it badly. As Shari Hiller states:,

“A beautifully decorated interior not only functions well, but it also creates a mood or feeling and shows off the personality of the family that lives there. It’s attention to these three important ingredients — function, mood and personality — that ensures decorating success”.

To help you wrap your mind around these basic rules and more intricate ingredients of great interior design, the following free courses and resources will set you on the right path.
