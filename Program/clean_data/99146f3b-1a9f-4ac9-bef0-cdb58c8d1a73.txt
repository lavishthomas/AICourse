In today's digitally driven world, it's no longer a surprise to any business that in order to remain viable and competitive, it's essential to have a strong online presence. When it comes down to search, Google is king: there are more than 2.3 million Google searches per minute — that's absolutely massive.

Your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) strategy is key to not only landing on the first page of Google search — usually the starting and stopping ground for most users when they query — it's also essential when it comes down to increasing your overall traffic. For example, if you have an eco-friendly dry cleaning business you're building downtown, you want that to pop up first when locals search for "green dry cleaning service."

Knowing that SEO isn't such an easy thing to pull off, using a tool that helps assist with automation could help: check out this Serpstat: Lifetime Subscription, a cloud-based all-in-one multi platform for SEO/PPC professionals and site owners.

The tool includes five intuitive modules: Global Rank Tracker and Backlink Explorer, Keyword Research and Competitor Analysis tools, and advanced SEO Audit. Any person who's tried to manage SEO knows the struggle of keeping up with the best keyword phrases and results, and Serpstat infinitely stores the top 100 search results for every keyword, not just the rank of one domain for a tracked keyword.

You'll be able to compare your keywords to main performance indicators, find keyword variations and search suggestions to improve your site's ranking and get a list of proven and profitable keywords that your competitors use — amongst other things.
