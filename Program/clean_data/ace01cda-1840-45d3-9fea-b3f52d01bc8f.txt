Raising kids is tough, and if you have a partner helping you, it’s good to be on the same page. Of course, it’s not possible to discuss every little thing before you start having kids, so if you’re a parent, what do you wish you’d talked about with your partner before you had kids?



Even if your kids are grown or you’re not with the other biological parent of your kid anymore, you might have advice that could help other soon-to-be parents talk about what matters. Over on the subreddit AskWomen, a similar question was posed and is are some of the most common topics people wish they’d talked about when it comes to raising kids:

How to deal with unwanted advice from others, especially close family members and friends.

Sharing the role of disciplining your kids and how you can support each other when the other is enforcing rules.

Who (if anyone) should stay home to care for the kids, and what that means for each of you in terms of chores and other tasks that keep a household running.

What to do if your kid has serious health issues, from ultrasound to issues that develop later in life.

How you can best support each other during the toughest times (like just after your kid’s birth or when they’re at an age that notoriously terrible).

Share your own topics in the discussion below. Beyond the topic, try to include why soon-to-be parents should talk about it and if you have any tips that worked well for you and your partner.
