For most of us, we buy a can of spray paint with its default nozzle, and we set about tackling whatever project we’re working on. Now, there are all kinds of nozzle width options. Tested explains the difference between each of them.

The default nozzle on most spray cans is basically the one-size-fits-all medium nozzle that we’re all familiar with. You can also get wider ones, called fat caps, which spray much wider and are best used for covering large areas. Going the opposite direction, you can get a tighter cap, which gets you a nice, thin line. You can tell which nozzle tip you spray can has based on the color on the tip. If you’ve never really bothered to check out different nozzle tips, they can be extremely useful for all kinds of projects.
