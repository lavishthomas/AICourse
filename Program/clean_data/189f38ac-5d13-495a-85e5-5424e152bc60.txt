Age may be nothing but a number, but nonetheless, it’s a sensitive subject. It’s a particularly complicated issue when it comes to dating.

A study has published findings that suggest the stereotype of older men finding younger women more attractive may not reflect reality and is in fact “too crude”.

According to reseacher Jan Antfolk of Abo Akademi University in Turku, men are also attracted to women their own age, and their preferences mature. Antfolk also stresses that neither men nor women base their romantic choices on age alone.

“Some older men have a strong preference for younger women, but most tend to also find older women attractive,” he told CBS News. “An interesting finding is that as men age, they become less picky about age. They report an interest in both younger and older women.”

In which case, some men may be missing a trick by only dating younger women. So without further ado, here’s 9 reasons why men over 50 should consider dating women their own age…

1. You will be at a similar stage in life

Couples who retire together often appear to have the most enviable of lifestyles. As a mature dater, if you date a woman your own age, you will have more scope to plan your dream retirement together - as it’s a phase of life you are likely to be entering at a similar time. You may have around the same level of fitness, and be a more even match when it comes to your favourite pursuits.
