I strongly believe that pancakes are the greatest "anytime" food — they shouldn't be reserved strictly for breakfast or brunch because they also make a filling lunch or dinner or snack. Basically anytime is the right time for pancakes, except when you don't have time to cook a whole batch — or don't need to.

Pancakes for One = Two Pancakes

Single-serve pancakes consist of two perfectly cooked cakes, ideal for sandwiching with butter and drizzling with maple syrup.

Self-Rise Flour to the Rescue

Self-rising flour is a shortcut ingredient we've used in many of our single-serve recipes. It eliminates the need for flour, baking powder, and salt. It's one small swoop towards kicking a pancake craving. If self-rising flour isn't something you have on hand, you can whisk up 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon fine salt. Measure off 1/4 cup for your pancakes; the rest can be stored in an airtight container for future use.

Whipped Egg White

Have you tried Kitchn's lofty pancake recipe? It's so named for the rise it gets from egg whites. Now, in that recipe the egg whites aren't whipped because the addition of buttermilk helps make the pancakes tender and fluffy. Here, whipping the egg white to soft peaks (a seemingly fussy task) makes a mini-batch of lofty pancakes. You don't need to whip out the mixer for this egg white, though — a single egg white is a breeze to whisk by hand.

Combine the dry ingredients: Whisk together the self-rising flour and sugar in a small bowl.
