2. Start with the bedroom. It's where you'll be spending almost a third of your time when you're at home, after all. If you're on a tight budget, opt for new bedding first, but don't skimp on thread count! Buy as well as you can afford to spend in this area â€” it makes a huge difference. If you have a little more money, paint the bedroom walls to complement your new bedding. Still more cash in your pocket? Add coordinating window treatments. Early risers should opt for a lighter palette of colors and more translucent treatments. Night owls who like to sleep in will probably likely be more satisfied with deeper tones and more substantial coverings that block out the light. If you're really ready to splurge, buy that bed you've always dreamed about. And choose carefully. It should mirror your personality, fit your room comfortably and stay with you for years.
