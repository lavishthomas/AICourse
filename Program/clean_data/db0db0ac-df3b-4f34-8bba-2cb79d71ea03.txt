Let’s say you’ve finally moved to a home or apartment with enough outdoor space for a little garden to call your own. What sort of tools will you need to get started? Are all trowels created equal? This video explains the basics of what you’ll need.

In the above video, This Old House talks with landscape designer Jenn Nawada about her gardening essentials. Any old trowel from the hardware store will do, but she recommends a Japanese hori hori knife with a depth gauge if you mean serious business. You’ll also need a small hand rake, a pruner (she prefers bypass pruners, which give a clean cut without crushing the plant), nitrile-dipped gloves to maintain tactile sensitivity, and a few other essentials. Watch the video for a few more gritty gardening details.
