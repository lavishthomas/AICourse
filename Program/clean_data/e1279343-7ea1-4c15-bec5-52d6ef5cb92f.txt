Rossi came third at the British MotoGP race at Silverstone on Sunday

Nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi has had "a successful operation" after suffering a double leg fracture in a training accident in Italy, his Movistar Yamaha team said.

The Italian suffered "displaced fractures of the tibia and fibula of his right leg" in Thursday's crash.

Rossi, 38, is fourth in the MotoGP standings, with the next race in Misano, San Marino on 10 September.

But, in a statement on the team website, Rossi said he "felt good".

"I'm very sorry for the incident. Now I want to be back on my bike as soon as possible. I will do my best to make it happen", he added.

Rossi is 26 points behind MotoGP series leader Andrea Dovizioso with six races left.

The motorsport legend, who suffered a bad break to the same leg in 2010 during a practice crash at Mugello, was also in hospital in May after suffering chest and stomach injuries in a motorcross accident.
