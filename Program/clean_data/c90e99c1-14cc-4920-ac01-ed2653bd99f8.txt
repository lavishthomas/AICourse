This stunning spiral galaxy has an explosive past with not one but two enormous supernovas occurring in the last 200 years.

This enhanced-color image of Jupiter’s south pole and its swirling atmosphere was created with the JunoCam imager. The photo was made about 63,400 miles above the planet’s cloud tops.

This is a barred spiral galaxy, recognizable by their spiral arms which fan out not from a circular core, but an elongated bar cutting through the galaxy’s center. This shot from Hubble is taken face on, which makes the spiral arms less obvious.

This impact crater on Mars is 5.5-miles in diameter with a central peak. Once an impact crater occurs, an ejecta curtain forms immediately after, contributing to the raised rim visible at the top of the crater’s walls. These central peaks can expose rocks that were previously deeply buried beneath the surface.

Enceladus, the largest of Saturn’s six moons, may be a potentially hospitable location in the future. Cassini mission observations show water jets sending icy grains into space. Under its icy crust is a global ocean and it may have hydrothermal activity.

The Larsen Ice Shelf is situated along the northeastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the fastest-warming places on the planet. In the past three decades, two large sections of the ice shelf have collapsed. A third section seems like it’s on a similar trajectory with a new iceberg poised to break away soon.
