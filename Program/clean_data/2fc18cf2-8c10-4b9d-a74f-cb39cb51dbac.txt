No.



Planets can appear to move backward (in a “retrograde” direction) sometimes. That’s a fact: thanks, physics. But this or any other motion of the planets does not influence whether your phone breaks, whether a contract is a bad one to sign, or whether you need to reconnect with an old friend (as today’s horoscope tells me I should do). This is astrology, and astrology is the same old bullshit it always has been. Sorry.
