Before you spend your last three paychecks on makeup again, read this first.

2. Most regular Sephora shoppers probably know this, but for newbies: Anyone can become a Beauty Insider to rack up points ($1 = 1 point) that can go toward 100-point, 250-point or 500-point gifts of free stuff. Beauty Insiders also get a little birthday gift, like a mini makeup kit or a body wash. Share On email Share On email

6. Customers who spend $350 annually reach VIB status (Very Important Beauty Insider). This mostly gets you a free makeover and invitations to in-store events. There was once a VIB event where customers could meet Jennifer Aniston for 750 points, but that's not quite the norm. Share On email Share On email

11. Every shopper is supposed to leave with samples of "something new, something they haven't used before and want to try," a former employee told Buzzfeed. "Keep saying you'd like to try new stuff. Tell the cast member what you've never tried before," she said. "Mention something you'd like to 'work on,' like, 'I'm working on these post-acne marks right now and don't know what to try' or 'I'm working on a good fragrance for summer.'"

12. Each Sephora has three "worlds" â€” fragrance, skincare, and color. Technically, you can get as many samples as you want from each. Though you can get a sample from pretty much any product (except eyeliners and mascara), employees recommend you stick to products that are liquid or come in a tube. Employees are also often experts in one "world," so if they're wandering around without helping you, ask them if there's someone who is an expert in that department. Share On email Share On email

13. Sephora is meant to be a "teaching store." Ask a knowledgable employee to do a "half face" on you. This is when they put makeup on one side of your face while teaching you how to apply everything, and then have you put the other side of your face together. Share On email Share On email
