Looking to add some extra color and nutrition to your meals this season? Try growing your own vegetables! Fix has growing tips for every size space.

If you're interested in creating a container garden, vegetables like cucumber, eggplant, and green onion are perfect candidates for this potted practice. Just make sure you avoid dark-colored or treated wood containers, and ensure that your plant is placed in direct sunlight for at least six hours every day.

Are you a salad lover? Then a shallow rooting raised bed garden is perfect for you! Grow lettuce, arugula, spinach, and endive and indulge in leafy goodness! Use wood, brick, rocks, or cement blocks to frame the bed. Pro tip: have the long side of the bed facing south for equal light exposure.

If you have some extra space you can try creating a garden plot. You can even increase garden yields by pairing plants with adequate companions. Vegetables like carrots pair well with peas, lettuce, onion, sage, and tomato!

Whether you have ample space for a garden plot or just a sunny window for a container garden, homegrown produce can add a fresh, delicious element to your meals! Get growing and try one of these gardens this spring!
