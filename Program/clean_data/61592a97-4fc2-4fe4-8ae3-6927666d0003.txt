Flossers are not only good for your teeth, they also work better than a needle tool or a cutting wire to level off the rim of a pot. Plus they're CHEAP. Like a pack of 100 for $3! That's basically a couple lifetimes supply or you can give them to every potter you know :D They can be reused many, MANY times! Not a one time use thing. . . . #potsinaction #pottery #ceramics #ceramic #satisfying #خزف #tools #keramik #contemporaryart #陶器 #céramique #cerámica #陶瓷 #howitsmade #도예 #spiral #cropcircles #Albuquerque #newmexico #керамика #sgraffito #ceramicartist #dash #cerâmica #clay #ceramiche #instaart #کوزه #howto
