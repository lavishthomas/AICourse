Catharhome has created Brikawood, ecological and economic interlocking wooden bricks that can be used to easily assemble a home without the use of nails and screws.

The brick consists of 4 wooden elements, two lateral flanges and two transverse spacers (spacers), machined in “dovetail” which are assembled together, by interlocking, thus giving a mechanical rigidity to the assembly.
