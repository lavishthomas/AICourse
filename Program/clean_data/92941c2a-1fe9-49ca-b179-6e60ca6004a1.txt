MONTH OF September

MONTHLY OVERVIEW:

[editoriallinks id="940a20d9-3f2d-4111-99ba-e52d6eab1532"][/editoriallinks]

Relationships are the main theme this month, as the Sun, buoyed by other planetary players, makes its way through the most committed regions of your chart. El Sol will visit your opposite sign of Virgo until September 22, helping you balance the give-and-take in all of your closest connections. Whether you’re negotiating a contract, figuring out how to let a friendship evolve or investing your heart in a romantic situation, honest and open dialogue is the key.

Pisces rules the imagination, and you often escape into the safe zone of your flowing thoughts and feelings. Swim out into the open waters now, Fish. Let others contribute to your world as equal partners and players. With energizing Mars riding shotgun in Virgo from September 5 to October 22, your bonds get a major booster shot. Negotiations can move swiftly, and they might get heated—but the fast pace could also be exciting. Romantic chemistry can also morph into happily-ever-after a lot sooner than you imagined. For couples, this is an exciting time to try new adventures that push past the same old same old.

Warning: Impatient Mars can spark an argumentative streak, and you could find yourself bickering more than usual. Choose your battles: Are you fighting because you’re irritated or because you actually have a point? With assertive Mars here, you won’t be pushed around or cast as the passive Pisces in this narrative. Be direct and fight back if someone tries to trample on your rights. Keep your focus on resolving the conflict and creating a diplomatic compromise for all.

Brokering peace has been tricky this summer, thanks to communication planet Mercury being retrograde (http://astrostyle.com/mercury-retrograde/) from August 12 to September 5. Mercury was backing through Virgo and your relationship house until August 31, which may have left you a bit shell-shocked. You’ve withstood quarrels and misunderstandings, both online and with the people you’re around most. There are no safe harbors there, Pisces. An ex or a former rival may have resurfaced, or maybe you weren’t in the mood for heavy one-on-ones. This month is a whole ‘nother story, as the stars revive your appetite for good company and collaboration.

From August 31 to September 5, Mercury will finish its backspin in Leo and your sixth house of health and organization. This wonky grand finale could make you feel disorganized and stressed as you shift into “back to school” mode. It could be hard to stay on top of details, and you’re sure to find errors everywhere you look. Messes you’ve been ignoring could irk you to distraction now. Use this time to clean, purge, declutter and sort through any summer pileups. But hold off on launching any fall fitness plans or scheduling appointments until Mercury corrects course, when communication and technology are back on your side.

You’ll get a lovely parting gift the day after Mercury straightens out. On September 6, the year’s only Pisces full moon illuminates your first house of self and personal passions. The spotlight is on you at this annual lunar event, which prompts you to take bold action. You might radically revamp your appearance or adopt a confident new attitude. Maybe you’ll finally share your talents with the greater public instead of hiding them.

This is the culmination of the February 26 Pisces new moon, which was also the final solar eclipse in a two-year series. Since 2015, those eclipses in your sign transformed your personal identity and closest relationships in huge ways. The February eclipse was the last push into these autonomous new waters. Now you can reap the rewards of your gutsiest moves—which haven’t been easy. You might feel a bit of the angst and triumph that fellow Pisces Kesha pours into her song “Praying” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Dur3uXXCQ), especially if you had to reinvent some part of your life from the bottom up.

This affirming full moon reminds you what you hold dearest—and not to compromise that! It’s a lesson you can lean on at the September 20 Virgo new moon, which kicks off a fresh six-month chapter in your relationship house. You could explore a business partnership or start getting serious with a romantic plus-one. But before you make anything official, ground yourself. This new moon will form an awkward quincunx (www.astrostyle.com/aspects/quincunx) with unpredictable Uranus in your second house of work, money and daily routines. Chaos in your schedule or financial fluctuations could interrupt the smooth sailing of your relationships. Make sure you hammer out all the practical details of your life before you approach the negotiating table.

There will be plenty more strategy sessions starting September 22, when the Sun plunges into Libra and your intimate eighth house of merging and joint ventures. From emotional bonds to business undertakings, you’re going all in—or making a clean break. There’s no gray area or half-stepping now. For the next four weeks, tend to the blazes of your most consuming connections or pour yourself into a passion project that keeps you wild-eyed into the wee hours. You’ve got license to #obsess as long as you give your fierce focus to a worthwhile cause.

With expansive Jupiter completing a 13-month lap through Libra on October 10, your get one last chance to lean all the way into those depths. Jupiter is the risk taker of our skies. You might just go for it and get engaged, partner up financially or complete a transformational period of spiritual growth. If you’ve been unsure how enmeshed to get with another person or entity, use this time to explore the options fully.

Stay mindful that you don’t veer into controlling or power-tripping turf—or jump rashly in OR out. On September 28, Jupiter will lock into its third and final opposition (http://astrostyle.com/aspects/opposite/) with shock jock Uranus in your second house of work, money and self-esteem. Jupiter and Uranus are the most freedom-loving planets, and they’re battling for supremacy. These two heavenly heavyweights only oppose each other every 14 years; their last two face-offs were on December 26, 2016, and March 3, 2017. Look back to those dates for clues of what could resurface for a grand finale.

Under these unpredictable and hotheaded skies, there can be curve balls around your feelings, finances or both. An unplanned expense could find you scrambling to cover it or dipping into savings. You may need to scale back some expenses or adjust your financial planning unexpectedly. Work or real estate changes might spring up, creating short-term chaos. If a relationship has become undermining, this opposition will give you the guts to either leave or take charge of the situation.

Unhappy at work? You might have an epiphany about a higher professional calling. But this planetary aspect has “don’t quit your day job” written all over it. Resist the temptation to rashly resign. If you’re making an investment or any kind, don’t just “go with your gut” and skip the proper research. This is the third Jupiter-Uranus face-off, and with any luck, you’ve learned a few lessons about how haste makes waste. The big teaching here is balance, though you could be tempted to act impulsively or throw the baby out with the bathwater. Breathe, Pisces! You don’t have to make life-altering decisions at this EXACT MOMENT.

You’ll get by with a little help from your friends starting September 28, when shadowy Pluto ends a five-month retrograde in Capricorn and your eleventh house of teamwork and technology. Dynamics have been dicey in group settings since April, when calculating Pluto went rogue. Perhaps you discovered someone untrustworthy in your midst or felt energetically drained trying to keep up with everything going on in the world. The current political climate is hard enough for anyone to stomach, much less you, the zodiac’s empath. If you’ve been on a social media hiatus (and who could blame you?), you can get back to posting and connecting without the FOMO and drama. A much-needed time-out could help a wayward collaboration get back on track. Refocus everyone on the shared mission. And feel free to block the haters, trolls and disruptive people who undermine your noble efforts.

LOVE & ROMANCE:

Relationship mojo: rising! From September 5 to October 22, fiery and passionate Mars will blaze through Virgo and your committed relationship house, turning up the heat. A budding connection could move quickly into official status, or you could feel motivated to meet someone with long-term potential. Single Pisces, beware the comparison trap: With stressful Mars here, you might feel pressured to pair up, especially as we creep closer to the holidays. Do your best to ignore those external agitators—but DO enjoy the upwelling of interesting prospects you’ll attract with passionate Mars in your corner.

For couples, this Mars cycle—which only happens every two years—can dial up your desire and drive, no matter how long you’ve been together. Get more adventurous, both behind and outside of closed doors. Experiment with things that are a little out of your comfort zone—preferably both of yours. This may sound like a “duh” revelation, but research actually shows that couples who try new things together are happier (http://www.businessinsider.com/couples-who-try-new-things-together-are-happier-2016-8).

Caution: Combative Mars can also stir up tension. Since gentle Pisces aren’t exactly famous for addressing issues head-on, the red planet’s aggressive influence could make you a bit TOO direct all of a sudden. Couples may argue more, and fights could get ugly. While Venus is in Leo and your analytical sixth house until September 19, your critical streak may get mean-spirited. You might home in on every flaw or be ultra-picky, turning the smallest gaffes into deal breakers. The culprit behind your scathing mood could be a flare-up of insecurity and body image issues, sparked by Venus in this perfectionistic zone. Go easy on everyone, starting with yourself!

When Venus enters Virgo from September 19 to October 14, this gloves-off intensity will lighten up. Harmonizer Venus helps smooth out any rough edges and inspires you to compromise. Hosting BOTH love planets in your partnership house doesn’t happen every day, so take advantage of the rare opportunity. No matter what your relationship status, this is a great time to take a romantic risk and pour your best energy into creating a happy, fulfilling love life.

Opportunity Days:

September 13: Sun-Saturn square

A relationship could hit a testing point. Are you on the same page? Do you need to have clearer boundaries—or maybe let down a few steely defenses? This tense alignment might reveal where some “daddy issues,” or a fear of being hemmed in, are blocking the flow of your love life.

September 24: Mars-Neptune opposition

Do you really know what you want from a relationship, Pisces? You could make a hard-to-reverse decision out of insecurity or desperation today. Lose the delusion that you’re not “enough” on your own—the serial monogamy routine may just be causing you to settle for duds. Or YOU might be the one getting cold feet. Chances are you just need some personal space without anyone breathing down your neck. A jealous or possessive person needs to back up a few hundred feet—and give you some room to roam!

September 28: Jupiter-Uranus opposition

Disrupt the status quo…or taint someone’s trust? Today’s reckless face-off of these two rash planets could find you shaking up the stability of your love life. An emotional outpouring may take one of you by surprise, or you might discover something that makes you question what you’ve taken for granted.

Challenge Days:

September 10-30: Mercury in Virgo

Talkative Mercury returns to your partnership house—moving forward this time! It’s a great time for couples to get back in sync and for single Fish to meet someone with long-term potential.

September 12: Venus-Saturn trine

Love doesn’t have to be so complicated, Pisces! Get back to basics today, focusing on your shared goals. Drop the drama and be an adult, addressing problems with an open heart and giving your partner the benefit of the doubt (if deserved). Your own pickiness and perfectionism may have caused you to pass up a perfectly suitable match or two. We’re not saying you should lower your standards—just give mere mortals a chance.

September 18: Venus-Uranus trine

Change doesn’t have to be hard or upsetting. Today’s transformational trine between love planet Venus and innovative Uranus touches the more stable and practical zones of your chart. Small shifts in your practices and routines can add up to a huge difference in your love life. Try something new today, whether dressing up, going home via a different route or shopping at a new grocery store. It could revitalize you—or put you in the path of someone special on your adventures!

September 20: Virgo new moon

A new moon sweeps through your partnership house, energizing your closest ties. It’s time for a fresh approach to love with your current amour or someone else. Couples can get back in sync, leaving grudges behind and starting anew.

September 30-October 17: Mercury in Libra

Communicator Mercury dives into your secretive eighth house, helping you get vulnerable and share hidden feelings. Share a desire you’ve kept under wraps or exchange some racy banter. Couples might talk cohabitation, marriage, babies or setting up long-term finances.

MONEY & CAREER:

Bring on the dynamic duos! The Sun is zipping through Virgo and your seventh house of partnerships, restoring harmony to your bonds. For the first three weeks of the month, focus on clear and effective communication. Mental Mercury will join the Sun in Virgo from September 10 to 30 after completing a disruptive retrograde that lasted from August 12 to September 5. Just as Mercury corrects course, motivator Mars enters Virgo and this same balancing zone of your chart, lending confidence and charisma to your interactions. A gutsy agent, headhunter or representative could advocate for you. Ask a well-connected person in your field to write a glowing testimonial on your behalf or a friend or former colleague to make a helpful introduction that could get your foot in the door. With aggressive Mars here, watch out for a tendency to be argumentative or pushy. Give people a chance to think over your proposals before you pressure them for an answer.

On September 6, the Pisces full moon shines a spotlight on your grandest personal goals. This is the culmination of the February 26 Pisces new moon (also a potent solar eclipse), and it will bring your birthday wishes to manifestation. Since full moons can signify endings, it might be time to release an outmoded habit or self-defeating belief that no longer serves your best interests. The Virgo new moon on September 20 plants even more seeds for promising partnerships. Does a loyal member of Team Pisces deserve more recognition? Give credit where it’s due and help them ascend alongside you. Treating your tireless cohorts fairly will inspire them to work harder toward your greater mission.

On September 22, the Sun shifts into Libra and your eighth house of joint ventures and long-term finances for a month. You’ll gain insight about who can be trusted for the long haul. Explore opportunities to merge your resources for mutual gain or to make a savvy investment. Passive- income prospects could pop up, such as a chance to earn affiliate money, royalties or commissions.

Collaborations get another boost later this month, when powermonger Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde on September 28. Since April, Pluto has been backing through your eleventh house of teamwork and technology, sparking power struggles or shady agendas. Tension could arise that same day, when an unpredictable Jupiter-Uranus opposition shakes up your financial houses. Be careful about borrowing or loaning money, especially among friends. Spell out all the terms in writing before signing on the dotted line. You could be tempted to jump in or out of a job or investment. Keep a cool head!

Opportunity Days:

September 2: Mars-Uranus trine

Productivity soars when you’re experimental and open to savvy new solutions. Incorporate technology that will help you manage your budget, schedule and team communications. Yes, Pisces, there IS an app for that!

September 6: Pisces full moon

Air your truth! If you’ve been suppressing your voice and true feelings, the year’s only full moon in your sign brings it out into the open. A solo endeavor you’ve been working on since your birthday could come together brilliantly. Is it time to launch? Break free from confining situations now—you need more autonomy!

September 9: Sun-Pluto trine

You’re in with the in-crowd! Today’s alignment of the strong-minded Sun and transformational Pluto touches down in the interpersonal zones of your chart. You could ink a deal or join forces with a well-connected person. Strategic networking can also pay off handsomely. Turn to your tribe, using both in-person and social media channels, to help you spread the word. With their endorsement, a project or message might just go viral.

September 10-30: Mercury in Virgo

Let’s make a deal! With talkative Mercury in your partnership house, you may consider a collaboration or hash out the fine points of a partnership. Explore the option of joining forces for mutual gain, but start with a trial project to test your synergy in real time.

September 20: Virgo new moon

A new moon in your contracts and commitments house plants the seeds for new alliances. If you team up with someone whose skills balance out yours, you could become quite the dynamic duo over the next six months.

September 28: Pluto retrograde ends

Rivalries, power struggles and hidden agendas may have tainted a group endeavor for the past five months. Now shadowy Pluto ends its backspin, helping everyone get back on the same page. You may need to let a petty person or gossipmonger go. You know what they say about that one bad apple.

September 30-October 17: Mercury in Libra

Privacy please? Expressive Mercury dives into your eighth house of research, depth and shared finances. You need quiet time to put the puzzle pieces together. Maybe you’re considering a joint venture that could lead to a mutual win-win. Organize your long-term finances and talk to an adviser about your options and future plans.

Challenge Days:

September 5: Sun-Neptune opposition

Dueling demands. You’re pulled between the competing needs of relationship and self, or unsure about where to direct your energy. Someone could be giving you a guilt trip or using emotional blackmail to get their way. Don’t fall for it.

September 13: Sun-Saturn square

People pleasing? It’s a sad fact, Pisces: You’ll never get ahead if you’re constantly worried about upsetting people or wanting them like you. While your sensitive sign hates conflict, you could be selling yourself short (and OUT) to keep the peace. Don’t build your own glass ceiling. Focus on being respected and know that you have a right to assert healthy boundaries, too.

September 24: Mars-Neptune opposition

Indecisive. Someone is pushing you to make a decision, but you’re just not sure what you want. Don’t succumb to their pressure and timeline. You don’t owe anybody anything here. It’s okay to request a few extra days to think about it. Then, go do some Pisces-style soul-searching. Your intuition will give you the answer soon enough!

September 28: Jupiter-Uranus opposition

Lock up your wallet. Hey there, highroller—don’t gamble it all in one place! The year’s second, wild-swinging faceoff strikes your money sectors, which could tempt you to bet your whole hand on a risky endeavor or impulsively quit your job with nothing else lined up. Change is good and probably overdue, but doing it in such a reckless way may capsize the whole ship when all you wanted was just to enjoy a few gentle waves. This is not a good day to sign any legal documents unless you’ve carefully considered and reviewed them. While your sign often “goes with your gut,” relying on intuition without research is just plain foolish today.

Love Days: 14, 20

Money Days: 26, 8

Luck Days: 23, 6

Off Days: 16, 21
