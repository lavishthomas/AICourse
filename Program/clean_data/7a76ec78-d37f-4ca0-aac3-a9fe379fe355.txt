You probably (hopefully) track your budget every month, but your net worth doesn’t need quite as much attention. It’s still a good idea to keep an eye on it. Do you do it?

Personal finance site Super Millennial suggests that tracking your net worth every month is necessary to maintain perspective of your financial goals. You may be stretching your budget thin this month, but if you can see that your net worth has increased over the last year, then you can feel assured that you’re on the right track.
