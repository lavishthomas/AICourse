Last Friday, we mentioned how Google's artificial intelligence software DeepMind has the ability to teach itself many things. It can teach itself how to walk, jump and run. Even take professional pictures. Or defeat the world's best player of the Chinese strategy game, Go. The science of teaching computers how to do things is called Deep Learning. And you can now immerse yourself in this world by taking a free, 3-month course on Deep Learning itself. Offered through Udacity, the course is taught by Vincent Vanhoucke, the technical lead in Google's Brain team. You can learn more about the course via Vanhoucke's blog post. Or just enroll here. (You will need to create an account with Udacity to get started.)

The free course takes about 3 months to complete. It will be added to our list of Free Computer Sciences courses, a subset of our larger collection, 1,250 Free Online Courses from Top Universities.
