SAN FRANCISCO — The debut of the photography center at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA) last year called attention to the remarkable concentration of local collectors in the field.

Now one of them, the chief executive of Chronicle Books, Nion McEvoy, is preparing to open a nonprofit arts space, which will display photographs and other artworks from his collection, in the popular Minnesota Street Project gallery complex, a few miles south.

“I live in a modest home, and I’d say 85 percent of my works are in storage,” said Mr. McEvoy, an SFMoMA trustee. “So this is a great opportunity to take some art out for public view and also work with other members of the creative community,” he noted, describing plans for the space to host public talks, performances and “shows of things I don’t collect.”

Set to open Oct. 28, the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts will have about 5,000 square feet of exhibition space — large for the Minnesota Street Project but small compared to fellow collector Andrew Pilara’s Embarcadero warehouse known as Pier 24. Mr. McEvoy said he sees the space as a “way to be casual and flexible in ways that a museum cannot be.”
