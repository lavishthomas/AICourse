By now, we should all be well aware of the fact that coconut oil is a serious "jack of all trades" when it comes to skin and hair care. We here at MBG headquarters are hardcore converts to the coconut oil way of life: from a simple hair moisturizer to an all-natural makeup remover, we're hooked.

What we didn't realize is just how versatile this product really is. Sure, coconut oil rocks on its own, but combining it with other all-natural ingredients takes its uses to the next level. Luckily, our friends at Health Perch are making it easy in the infographic below. Coconut oil eyeliner, coconut oil sunscreen ... the possibilities are (nearly) endless!

What's your favorite way to use coconut oil?
