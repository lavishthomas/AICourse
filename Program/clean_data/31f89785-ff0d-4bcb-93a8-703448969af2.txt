If you own your home, there are lots of little ways you can improve your house for long-term energy savings that cut down your utility bills. The Department of Energy has a whole page dedicated eight of these projects with in-depth guides.

At the Department of Energy’s site below you’ll find eight guides for home improvement projects like sealing air leaks with caulk or insulating your water heater tank. Each guide includes step-by-step instructions. Some, like the one above, even come with a video to show you what you’re doing. All these projects are part of the DOE’s overall EnergySaver program designed to reduce U.S. energy consumption. Check out the full list of projects below.
