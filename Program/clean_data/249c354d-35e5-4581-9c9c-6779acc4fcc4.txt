I don’t know about you, but I’m bored of picking between these mainstream cuisines. So when I heard about Molecular Gastronomy, I was intrigued, especially when I learned it’s right here in our metros. It’s basically Indian food, broken down to it’s individual flavours and then presented in a different way, sometimes as an amalgamation with other cuisines. So I decided to stalk a little and what I saw, made me want to keep the food in a museum.

The presentation skills are just as kickass as the flavour and we’re going to make you crave a plate of everything right now.
