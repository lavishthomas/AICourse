Here’s a great recipe for those days when you leave the house early and won’t be back until dinner time.

Prep this skillet pasta in the morning before you leave – or even the night before — and pop it in the oven when you’re home from work, your kid’s soccer practice, the last beach run of the season, or whatever activities have filled your day.

This is not exactly mac and cheese for grownups but it’s close. It has a little more substance in the form of yellow squash and cherry tomatoes, and it’s bound together with eggs and cream. When summer squash isn’t in season, you could substitute zucchini or any other favorite vegetable.

In the oven, the top becomes golden and crunchy with melted Parmesan and crisp bits of pasta. Pockets of oozy fontina punctuate each slice. Sweet tomatoes and summer squash round out the flavors. A hefty dose of fresh basil finishes it all off.

This is simple, filling fare. You could try it with different pasta shapes, or switch up the cheeses. Just be sure to toss the pasta with some Parmesan and salt and pepper before you add the rest of the ingredients to boost the cheesy flavor.
