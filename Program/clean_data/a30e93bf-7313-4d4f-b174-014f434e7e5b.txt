If your garden tool storage consists of a corner of your garage with rakes, shovels, and lots of other free ranging tools piled haphazardly in a corner you'll appreciate this tool rack design from DIY household weblog Ashbee Design.

The creator had leftover 6" PVC pieces from a previous project and knew that she could devise a great tool organizer from the leftover pieces. After being cut at an angle (to maximize access when attaching to the wall) the PVC pieces were drilled and then mounted to a large piece of Â¾" plywood. The author created eight PVC rings to hold two handed tools and additional rings at the bottom to organize handheld tools such as trowels and hatchets. Finally, labels were made with yellow tape to enhance visibility.
