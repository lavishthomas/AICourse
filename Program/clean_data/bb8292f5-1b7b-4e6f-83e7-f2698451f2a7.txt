There isn’t a curry that I don’t like. Well, as long as the spice level is is not outrageously crazy! This is a seafood curry that I made recently on television, and it’s a Caribbean Creole curry from the cookbook, Flavors of Belize (I made Beef Satay with Habanero Peanut Sauce from the book too).

I learned something new from cookbook author Tanya McNabb – Caribbean Creole is different from Louisiana Creole! Their cuisine features lots of seafood and use of coconut, so this recipe for Coconut Curry Shrimp with Coconut Rice is a perfect example of a Creolean speciality.

Not only does the recipe take only 20 minutes to make (the rice takes 20 minutes, the curry really only takes 7 minutes), but the spice level is mild, perfect for kids too. The curry flavor comes from yellow curry powder and ground green cardamom, so it’s warming and comforting. Of course, you can add more chile sauce if you wish!

The shrimp can be replaced with sea scallops or chunks of fish (grouper would be fantastic). The television crew loved it so much that we ate the entire dish minutes after filming!
