Adobe Home

Adobe is a natural building type which uses materials such as sand, clay, water and some type of fibrous or organic material like sticks, straw and/or manure. Builders shape the mixture into bricks using frames and it dries in the sun. This form of building is similar to cob and mud brick building. Adobes buildings are extremely durable and most of the oldest buildings in the world were constructed using this technique. This is a very great thermal material which means compared to wooden buildings in hot climates, adobe is a great insulator, although they are known to be rather susceptible to earthquake damage. Adobe homes are common in warm and hot climate areas including southwestern U.S.

Cannabricks Home



Cannabricks or hemp concrete is a mix of hemp hurd fiber, lime and water which preforms as a mildew, flame resistant and building insulation. This is one of the most common building materials; it has been widely used in Europe and has recently been used in the U.S. Researchers compared the hempcrete home and the traditional brick home and found that hempcrete construction process uses less energy and creates less waste. Hemp homes also take less fuel to heat, while still having a comparable water-tightness and durability and is expected to last an estimated 800 years. The main problem with hempcrete is acoustic; it doesn’t block sound as well as traditional construction. Hempcrete is widely described as carbon-neutral and seven times stronger than concrete, although, manufacturers of hempcrete insist it is not stronger than concrete, and shouldn’t be used as a structural capacity. As with most construction methods there are advantages and disadvantages, this is a material that has its benefits and flaws.
