Not every celebrity accepts a glass of wine or champagne at those A-list parties.

Many stars have admitted they don't drink, whether it be because of past addiction issues or by personal choice.

Earlier this week, Bradley Cooper opened up to GQ's Jan. 2014 issue about his past struggles with drugs and alcohol, explaining, "If I continued it, I was really going to sabotage my whole life."

"The one thing that Iâ€™ve learned in life is the best thing I can do is embrace who I am and then do that to the fullest extent, and then whatever happens, happens," he added. "The more steps I do to not do that, the farther I am away from fulfilling any potential I would have."

Here are 27 other stars who don't drink:
