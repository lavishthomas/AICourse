Whether youâ€™re into good olâ€™ drawing and painting, or quick editing in Photoshop or Illustrator, one thingâ€™s for sure: theyâ€™re all creativityâ€™s best friends. Some draw pictures all day1, while others find their inspiration in uncommon sources2 in order to break out of the box. Whatever it is that you decide to do, itâ€™s good to challenge yourself more often and get out of your comfort zone. If you donâ€™t, you may never discover something that you love doing, or perhaps even worse, never learn a whole lot about yourself.

If your excuse are pesky blackouts or simply having no clue what to create nor where to get started, donâ€™t fret! Even the most talented artists out there practice so much more than youâ€™d ever imagine, and hone their skills by trying out copywork3. The most important thing is to be confident and simply give it a try. For more encouragement, Iâ€™ve collected a good number of inspirational artwork that is bound to give you that spark you need to get started already!
