515 Free Online Programming & Computer Science Courses You Can Start in April

Five years ago, universities like MIT and Stanford first opened up free online courses to the public. Today, more than 700 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses.

I’ve compiled this list of over 515 such free online courses that you can start this month. For this, I leveraged Class Central’s database of over 7,000 courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating.

I’ve sorted all 515 of these courses into the following categories based on their difficulty level:

Beginner

Intermediate

Advanced

Many of these courses are completely self-paced. The rest will start at various times later this month. You can find complete lists of the technology-related courses starting later in 2017 on our Computer Science and Programming subject pages.
