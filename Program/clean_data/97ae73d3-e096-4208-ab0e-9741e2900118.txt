Alton Brown says stuffing is evil when it comes to turkey and offers an alternative method to save your Thanksgiving dinner.

He explains that stuffing a turkey usually means overcooking it:

That’s because stuffing goes into the middle of the bird and is extremely porous. That means as the turkey around it cooks, juices that may contain salmonella bacteria soak into the stuffing, which then must be cooked to a minimum of 165 degrees F in order to be safe.

The turkey will dry out. Instead, Brown recommends cooking your stuffing separately and then puting it in the turkey while the bird rests so it can collect those yummy juices. (We’ve shared the do-not-stuff recommendation before in our turkey-cooking guide, but I like the trick of having the stuffing in the turkey at the end for that turkey flavor.)
