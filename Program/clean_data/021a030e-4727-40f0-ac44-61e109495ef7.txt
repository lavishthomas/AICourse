Scrums are unique to rugby and are arguably the most recognisable, and baffling, part of the game. They are used to restart play when there has been a minor infringement, such as knocking the ball on (spilling it forward). The offending team hands the ball to the opposition, who have the ‘put-in’ at the scrum. This means they should win the ball and be able to attack or claim territory by kicking. Because both teams can compete for the ball the other side might be able to win a penalty, make it difficult for the team with the put-in to get the ball cleanly, or even win the ball themselves, known as a scrum against the head. So what role does each position play?
