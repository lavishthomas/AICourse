17. "My mom once sat me down and very seriously told me: 'The first few years of your relationship should be incredible.'" "'Not to say that you won't fight, but you should not be fighting all the damn time. If your partner is upsetting you this much now, imagine what it is going to be like a marriage, two kids, and several years from now. Take your time: People's tastes change, and it is much easier to throw out a couch than a husband.'" —submitted by Meghan Elizabeth Share On email Share On email

28. "Thank them for everything, even for the little things they do." "Saying 'Thank you for emptying the dishwasher' isn't just about the dishes — it says 'I notice you, I recognize that you work to make our home better, I value your efforts enough to call them out, and I do not take those same efforts for granted.' No one will ever get tired of being thanked, and at the same time it fosters an atmosphere of gratitude in the home — you may find yourself being thanked more often in return." —submitted by Jess Ballinger Share On email Share On email

They have study dates at the library. They have a cleaning service come in once a month because a clean house is more relaxing than a dirty one. They talk about their feelings all the time. They ask for what they need. They changed their furniture — went from a couch and recliner to a sectional — so they'd be more likely to snuggle with each other since they know that's important." —submitted by Jennifer Nelson Share On email Share On email
