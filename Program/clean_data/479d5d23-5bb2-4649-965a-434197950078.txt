The price of an out-of-print history book has risen 1,500% – because Elon Musk is reading it.

The 45-year-old CEO of Tesla Motors and founder of PayPal told a Bloomberg reporter that he was enjoying a 1929 study of historical risk-takers called Twelve Against the Gods, written by William Bolitho, a South African journalist who was a friend of Ernest Hemingway and Noel Coward. “It’s really quite good,” he said.

Before Musk mentioned the book, around 20 used copies were trading on Amazon.com for about $6, according to Bloomberg. A day later, however, the price had shot up to $99.99 per copy. By yesterday, there were no copies left for sale on Amazon.com at all.
