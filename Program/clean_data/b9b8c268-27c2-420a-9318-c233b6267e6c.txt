I'm often asked how to do a really great day look by ladies in their 50's, 60's and older. The main questions are usually how to make skin look even and fresh without emphasising lines and how to get eye definition without a harsh end result. Here I demonstrate techinques on 64 year old Yvonne to help achieve a modern, defined and natural look. So whether you are in this category or you'd like to help your mother (It is Mothers day in the UK next week!) or Grandmother do her make-up, hope you find it helpful X

Disclaimer

I canâ€™t guarantee that all of the make-up and skincare products I recommend will suit you. I only use products I personally think are good having tried them on myself and my clients but everyone's skin is different and it's possible to be allergic to anything. Wherever possible, test products out on yourself before purchasing.



I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.



I do not accept payment and am not sponsored to make any of the films on this channel. Some of the links under the videos and blog posts on my site are affiliated however and as stated before, I only feature products I like, or want to try.
