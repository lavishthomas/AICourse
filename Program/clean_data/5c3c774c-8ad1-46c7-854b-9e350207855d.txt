If you’re looking to use some vacation days, but you’re not sure where you want to go, travel booking site Wander lets you search based on your overall travel budget.

Fear not wanderlust-stricken soul. Whether you’ve saved up $500 or $5,000, there’s a trip out there for you. Using data from Skyscanner and Booking.com, Wander can plan out a trip for almost any budget. You plug in your home base airport, your overall budget for hotels and flights combined, how many are in your party, and when you’re available. Then bam! You’re shown all the places you can go and afford.

For example, I put in LAX with a budget of $800 and came up with trips to Mexico, Hawaii, Canada, and China. I was elated to see I could visit Hangzhou, China for around $738 if I’m willing to catch some inconvenient flights and stay in a hostel. Oh, and that’s for nearly a week’s stay. But if you’re not as adventurous and want a real hotel, Wander also lists plenty of other options (though you’ll eventually start to be shown things outside of your budget limit).

Wander does have a few limitations, however. You can’t refine your search results as much as you can with other travel search sites. You can search by continent, flight duration, and hotel price/rating, but you can’t filter by airline or hotel group—which sucks if you’re banking points. Even so, it’s a neat tool for the adventure seekers out there, or those looking to break the cycle of visiting the same places over and over. At the very least, it’s inspiring to see how affordable travel can be if you’re willing to give up some of the fancier things. And you might as well start your trip planning with a tool like this.
