Racing gets under way again at Melbourne on Sunday

The wait is almost over.

One hundred and 17 days after the curtain came down on the 2016 campaign at Abu Dhabi, Formula 1 is back as the new season gets under way in Australia this weekend.

With new rules and new era cars, it is a step into the unknown. Mercedes might be the favourites once again, but they could well have a real fight on their hands this time.

Where are we?

This will be the 22nd Formula 1 race to be held at Albert Park, while Melbourne has been the season-opener on 19 occasions

There will always be excitement about the start of a new season - the anticipation, the element of the unknown and the hope that this one will be even better than the last - but there is something about having Melbourne as the setting for the opener that makes it even more special.

With the city's shiny skyscrapers on one side and sailboats and surfers at St Kilda beach on the other, the Albert Park circuit offers a unique setting, winding its way around a glistening lake in idyllic parkland.

There's a real buzz about the place as fans turn out in big numbers, eager to see the new cars first hand, and that buzz extends to the paddock as team personnel and media meet up, often for the first time since the end of the previous season.

The cars are wider, more physically demanding to drive and much faster than last year, with lap times expected to drop by up to five seconds.

Bigger cars and extra downforce is, however, expected to make overtaking more difficult, with several drivers reporting after testing that it is difficult to follow another car closely.

More durable Pirelli tyres could also lead to more one-stop races.

Happy hunting ground for McLaren - the stats
