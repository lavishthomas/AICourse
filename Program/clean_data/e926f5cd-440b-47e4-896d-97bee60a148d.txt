There are a few different reasons why a car might stay on the road forever. When a model turns up on the list of most reliable vehicles every year, the automaker deserves a great deal of credit. The company created something that could stand the wear and tear of daily driving, regardless of climate or driver skill.

In some cases, owners have an attachment to the vehicle and will pay whatever it takes to keep it going. But it is not necessarily a good value to keep something just because it lasts. When you see work vehicles like pickup trucks or taxis ranking among the longest-lasting cars, you know the investment was probably worth it.

While 100,000 miles used to be a worthy goal for a vehicle, the bar has risen higher in recent years. Consumer Reports began publishing lists of cars most likely to hit 200,000 miles and keep on going even after reaching said goal. Search engines like iSeeCars have done the same, using results from actual cars that changed hands on the used market. Now, it’s time to look even higher.

Here are 20 cars that could take you to 300,000 miles and beyond. To compile the list, we included vehicles that had the highest percentage of cars lasting the longest, cars that have been the most reliable over the past decade, and cars that went on sale with the most miles. In some cases, vehicles met all three criteria.

1. Honda Civic

2011 Honda Civic | Honda 2011 Honda Civic | Honda

Sales figures are an obvious endorsement for the staying power of Honda Civic. Every year, the compact model places in the top 10 of all vehicles sold in America, and it made the list of longest-lasting among Consumer Reports subscribers in 2015, too. Finally, iSeeCars counted it among the cars that owners keep for 10 years or longer. It can hardly be a coincidence. If you want a safe bet for a compact car that could hit 300,000 miles, go with a Civic.



2. Subaru Legacy/Outback

2013 Subaru Legacy | Subaru 2013 Subaru Legacy | Subaru

If you look at owner satisfaction, dependability, and fuel economy, you’ll always find Subaru ranking among the best auto brands. Therefore, it was no surprise when we saw Legacy show up among cars lasting over 200,000 miles. The high-rated sedan, along with the Outback on which it is based, gives car owners a good chance at going to 300,000 miles and beyond. You’ll get your money’s worth with this one.

3. Toyota Tacoma

2015 Toyota Tacoma | Toyota 2015 Toyota Tacoma | Toyota

The new-for-2016 Tacoma didn’t get great reliability scores out of the gate, but this pickup had an incredible run earlier in this decade, and was a warrior in the early 2000s. When we conducted a search of used cars with more than 300,000 miles on them, the 2002 Tacoma was the most common result. As one of the most enduring models from the most reliable brand, used Tacomas are great bets to steam past your highest mileage goal.

4. Lexus CT 200h

2016 Lexus CT 200h | Lexus 2016 Lexus CT 200h | Lexus

There is no question about the durability of Toyota Prius, and Lexus buyers have access to the same platform in the CT 200h. Whatever you might compromise in engine power or handling, this car makes up for in fuel economy and overall dependability. Consumer Reports named it one of the most reliable cars of 2016 based on agency tests and consumer feedback. In short, it’s a good bet to go the distance — maybe as far as 300,000 miles.

5. Chevrolet Silverado 1500

2011 Chevrolet Silverado | General Motors 2011 Chevrolet Silverado | General Motors

Like Accord versus Camry, the annual battle between Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado 1500 is worth your attention. Both pickups are top sellers every year, and the automakers have a running battle to outperform the other on work sites. (Ford still has the edge.) If you look at trucks with a zillion miles on them, you’re going to find Silverado right there. These trucks are built to endure abuse and last forever, so there’s a good chance you can blow past 300,000 miles in one, as so many have in the past.

6. Honda Odyssey

2015 Honda Odyssey | Honda 2015 Honda Odyssey | Honda

Betting on a Honda to go the distance is fairly safe. This trend continues with the Odyssey, the popular minivan that can take a beating and refuses to die. iSeeCars data showed the Odyssey among the top 10 vehicles people keep longer than a decade, and Consumer Reports subscribers revealed it was among the most common with over 200,000 miles on the odometer. For a family car, Honda’s legendary reliability comes up big here.

7. Toyota Corolla

2014 Toyota Corolla | Toyota 2014 Toyota Corolla | Toyota

It seems like everyone has a friend or family member with a Corolla that’s been around forever. In fact, the data backs up any hunch you might have about this car’s dependability. Consumer Reports found it among the best in reliability for every model year between 2007 and 2017. If you were to pick up a used Corolla in good shape, you’d have a good shot at keeping it for another decade.

8. Ford F-150

2016 Ford F-150 | Ford 2016 Ford F-150 | Ford

The most popular cars are also sometimes the most reliable. With a little searching, you can find many older Ford F-150s for sale with 300,000 miles or more used, and Consumer Reports has named the best-selling vehicle in America a strong candidate to go several hundred-thousand miles. We wonder if (or how) that will change once F-150 goes hybrid. It could very well become the Prius of pickups: economical and impossible to kill.

9. Honda Accord

2014 Honda Accord | Honda 2014 Honda Accord | Honda

Honda Accord challenges Toyota Camry for the title of best-selling car every year for a reason: They last. You’ll always find Accord among the most reliable sedans, and it’s also one of the most common cars people keep for longer than a decade. If you drive carefully and change the oil on a regular basis, we wouldn’t be surprised if you steam past 300,000 miles in an Accord with little trouble. Go with the four-cylinder engine for the best value.



10. Toyota Highlander

2015 Toyota Highlander Hybrid | Toyota 2015 Toyota Highlander Hybrid | Toyota

The Toyota Highlander Hybrid led the pack among cars people keep 10 years or longer, and the standard Highlander was close behind it. These SUVs have staying power, rock-solid reliability scores, and the benefit of a strong brand behind it. Take good care of one and it might last well beyond 300,000 miles. With the best Toyotas, the sky — or infinity, since we’re talking about mileage — seems to be the limit.

11. Subaru Forester

2014 Subaru Forester | Subaru 2014 Subaru Forester | Subaru

Though it didn’t score quite as high as Legacy or Outback, Subaru Forester has posted a remarkable number of cars exceeding 200,000 miles since 2014. In the latest survey by iSeeCars, this model matched the tally of Prius and Corolla. Meanwhile, 24% of Forester owners ended up keeping their cars over 10 years in the study on long-term relationships with cars. If you were taking bets, this vehicle would have an excellent chance of staying on the road.

12. Ford Escape Hybrid

In 2005, when Ford launched the Escape Hybrid, the automaker was not known for electric powertrains. Early success in New York City taxi fleets changed that. The first 18 Escape Hybrids all accumulated over 175,000 miles in a year and a half on NYC streets. As of 2017, Escape Hybrids remained a significant part of the taxi fleet despite the model’s 2012 phase-out. Each one we’ve encountered had close to 400,000 miles on the odometer. If you see a used model, consider picking it up for the long haul.

13. Toyota Camry

2015 Toyota Camry | Toyota 2015 Toyota Camry | Toyota

The knock on Camry has always been about its boring characteristics. Funny how no one knocks its reliability or staying power. On the contrary, those things were always taken for granted with Camry. Naturally, it turned up among the cars with the highest number of models hitting 200,000 miles, so we have no doubt it can keep going after that. Over 20% of Camry owners keep their cars longer than 10 years, so it seems like a common goal.

14. Honda CR-V

2015 Honda CR-V | Honda 2015 Honda CR-V | Honda

In 10 straight years of Consumer Reports testing, Honda CR-V scored among the elite in reliability. This top seller, which ranked seventh in U.S. sales for 2016, tends to stick around households for over a decade. Over 25% of CR-V owners had their cars for longer than 10 years when they went to sell in 2016. Combine those two stats and you have a solid chance at hitting high mileage marks.

15. Lexus GX

The GX is that rare Lexus that doesn’t have a Toyota counterpart, but both models share the body-on-frame design that was the hallmark of the original SUVs. As far as reliability and ride quality go, Lexus GX delivers much better scores overall. It made the top 10 in the 2016 Consumer Reports list, and is known to eat up miles with ease. Next stop, 300,000.

16. Toyota Prius

2010 Toyota Prius | Toyota 2010 Toyota Prius | Toyota

Once upon a time, car buyers worried whether a hybrid battery would last long enough to make a Toyota Prius worth it. Well over a decade later, we know hybrid batteries are almost invincible. That’s how Prius ended up as No. 1 on the list of cars with more than 200,000 miles on them. (Some have broken the 600,000 mark.) The latest edition hasn’t lost its edge either: Consumer Reports had the new Prius leading two different classes for reliability in 2016.



17. Chevrolet Suburban

Suburban has had its share of safety and reliability issues over the years, but this behemoth sticks around for the long haul. Research by iSeeCars showed almost 5% of Suburbans showing better than 200,000 miles when they went up for sale in 2016. (Only four vehicles did better.) It might give you some headaches — avoid models from 2014 or later — but Suburban has proven to be “like a rock” overall.

18. Toyota Sequoia

Looking at 2016 used car sales, Sequoia had an extraordinary amount of models with over 200,000 miles. | Toyota Looking at 2016 used car sales, Sequoia had an extraordinary amount of models with over 200,000 miles. | Toyota

We’ll stop including so many Toyotas when they stop lasting so long. For now, we have no choice but to follow what the research shows: Toyota Sequoia is an excellent bet to exceed 300,000 miles on the odometer. The 2007 and 2008 models that ranked so high in reliability formed the backbone for the 4.8% that had over 200,000 miles on them when owners went to sell in 2016. Only a handful of cars did better.

19. Ford Expedition

2014 Ford Expedition | Ford 2014 Ford Expedition | Ford

Between 2014 and 2017, Ford Expedition has been among the most reliable vehicles in America, joining the “much better than average” class in Consumer Reports testing. (The 2012 and 2013 models are not recommended.) Add that reputation to a stunning percentage of models exceeding 200,000 miles and you have the goods for a truck ready for the long haul. If you need any more proof that it’s reliable, consider this: It’s based on the F-150 pickup platform.

20. Toyota RAV4

2013 Toyota RAV4 | Toyota 2013 Toyota RAV4 | Toyota

For a car that’s ranked among the top 10 in U.S. sales for years, Toyota RAV4 has an amazing percentage of owners who keep them for the long haul. Nearly 25% of RAV4 consumers had their vehicles for at least 10 years when they went to sell them in 2016. Model years 2012 through 2015 were among the very best in reliability, so you should find a keeper in that group.
