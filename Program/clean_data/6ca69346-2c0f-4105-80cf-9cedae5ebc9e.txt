The most basic money skills aren’t all that complicated, even if we make it so. To prove the point, Napkin Finance fits the basics into the space of a small napkin.

The site, which aims to educate its users on the principles of personal finance, uses handy abbreviated graphics to explain concepts like budgeting, interest, investing, loans, and credit cards. If you’re not familiar with the basics of personal finance, this is a great place to start.
