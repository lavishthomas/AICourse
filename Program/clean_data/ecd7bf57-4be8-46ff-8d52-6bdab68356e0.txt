Cutting back on carbs—whatever your reason—doesn't mean you have to go full-on Atkins or Paleo, either. For a reasonable way to control your consumption, nutrition experts, like registered dietitian Elizabeth Jarrard, refer to the Mayo Clinic’s guidelines, which recommend 60-130 grams of quality carbohydrates (read: whole grains and fiber-rich produce) a day. That leaves you with about 15 to 25 grams for dinner, Jarrard says. The delicious dishes below meet that low-carb criteria and are a cinch to whip up.
