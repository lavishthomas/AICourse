You may have heard of soffritto, that flavorful trinity of sauteed carrots, onion, and and celery that adds flavor and richness to everything it graces. You could saute up some soffritto each time you need it, or you could borrow this clever trick from Food 52 and keep a roll of it in the freezer, ready for instant use.



To make it, just chop up roughly equal parts of each vegetable and cook the onions in a good bit of olive oil or butter until they become translucent and start to smell divine. Add your other veggies, and cook until golden or darker, depending on your preference. Let your mixture cool, then roll up “like a Tootsie Roll” in a sheet of parchment paper. Place in a Ziploc bag, and pop the whole thing in the freezer. Next time your dinner needs some extra oomph, just slice off a little (or a lot) of this holy trinity and toss it into whatever sauce, stir fry, soup, or any other dish that would benefit from flavor (so like, everything).
