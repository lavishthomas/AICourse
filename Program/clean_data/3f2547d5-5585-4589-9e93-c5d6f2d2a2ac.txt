Understanding Transits of the Moon

The Moon enters (ingresses) into the next zodiac sign approximately every two to three days. It is not uncommon for the Moon to ingress all twelve signs within the month. Some months the moon will ingress into the zodiac signs fourteen times, however, the norm is thirteen ingresses per month.

To adjust the times for your timezone, add or subtract the number of hours your timezone is from 0 UT. If you live in the western hemisphere (mostly the Americas) you would subtract the number of hours from the time shown on the table. Most of the eastern hemisphere will add hours to the time shown in the table.
