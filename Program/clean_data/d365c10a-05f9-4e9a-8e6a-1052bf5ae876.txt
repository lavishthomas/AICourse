I love my crock pot. I use it ALL the time and year round. Crock pots are little life savers, especially on busy days! Itâ€™s such a good feeling to get dinner prepped and out of the way first thing in the morning. The extra bonus is smelling it cook all day. ðŸ˜€

This Creamy Ranch Chicken is a new crock pot favorite of ours. Itâ€™s dinner all in one! Youâ€™ve got your meat, potatoes and veggie cooked and ready to eat once the time is up. I love that! Not only is this recipe super convenient it is delicious. The ranch flavor is just perfect. Not too overpowering at all.

Give my Homemade Ranch Dressing Mix a try in this recipe. I bet you have all the ingredients in your pantry right now. ðŸ™‚
