We analyzed data from nearly 5,000 medical centers and survey responses from more than 30,000 physicians to rank hospitals in 16 adult specialties from cancer to urology. Survival rates, patient safety, specialized staff and hospital reputation were among the factors weighed. Across the country, only 152 hospitals ranked in at least one of the specialties in 2017-18. The Honor Roll recognizes 20 hospitals for their exceptional care across these specialties, as well as recognizes hospitals by state, metro and regional areas for their work in nine more commonly performed procedures and conditions.
