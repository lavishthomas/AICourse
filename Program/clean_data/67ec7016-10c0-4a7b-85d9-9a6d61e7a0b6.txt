Until two months ago, my only experience of Swiss produce was Milka’s Alpenmilch and Karl, the hydraulics engineer I dated in my late teens. I have fond memories of both, but Karl will forever occupy a special place in the corridors of my romantic history as the most efficient man I’ve ever met.

Karl would make the week’s meals on a Sunday night and freeze the lot in nutritionally balanced serving-shaped batches. And as reassuring as it was to know that come 7pm Wednesday we’d be chowing down on some chicken paprikash, those stacks of labelled Tupperware were to my sexual desire what a dart is to-a-hot-air balloon. Once, when after three months apart I flew to his Geneva apartment on the wings of teenage longing, Karl opened the front door, asked me to swap my shoes for plastic house slippers and then kissed me.
