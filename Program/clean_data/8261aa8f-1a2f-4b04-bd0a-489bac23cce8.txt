Man & Astrology

Astrology does not consider human beings to be influenced only by inheritance and environment but also by the state of our solar system at the time of birth. A horoscope shows character traits, personal behaviour and the influence of the current quality of time.

When you read the Daily Horoscope and the other horoscopes, please remember that the stars do not force you to do anything. The interpretations simply describe possibilities. You are the person who choses which of all these possibilities should have priority in your life and how you deal with your experiences.
