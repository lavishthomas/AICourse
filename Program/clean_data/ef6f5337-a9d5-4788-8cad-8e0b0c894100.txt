A good fleece vest can keep you warm on a chilly day, but thanks to Instructables user libraryCat, it can also be the ultimate storage device, complete with internal pockets to hold all of your gear. All you need is a fleece vest that fits, and a shirt you don't mind cutting up—both of which he found at his local thrift store.

Commercial products that do the same job (and admittedly are professionally made) can get kind of pricey, so it makes sense to try the DIY approach if you have the time and energy. libraryCat took a simple silver shirt and a black fleece vest, cut the shirt to fit inside the vest, and sewed it in as a new lining. With some of the excess fabric, he crafted an array of pockets and sleeves that he could use to hold his phone, sunglasses, even a bottle of water. He walks you through the process—and tells you how he created each pocket—at the link below, so hit that up for the details. You will need some sewing skills to make this work though.

It's a handy idea—especially if you like vests but wish they had a few more pockets—like a sleeve for your phone and place to stash your earbuds while you're out for a run. Oh, and we should mention—this is for fun, not for real spying, and make sure you empty those pockets when you go to the airport, okay? What do you think? How would you improve the design?
