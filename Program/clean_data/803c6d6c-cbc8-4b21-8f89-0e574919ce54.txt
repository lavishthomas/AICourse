Alton Brown gives you another fool-proof recipe to make something perfect and delicious: Grilled steak over coals. There's no way you can fail using his method—which will provide you with joy and happiness for the entire summer.

Alton uses a skirt steak for this method. His best trick in the video is to let the meat to get to room temperature—something that always has to be done when cooking meat on a grill or a pan. This is crucial for the final result to be perfect. If you cook meat out of the fridge, it will always end like shit.

Their recipe to make the perfect bone-in ribeye steak at home is fool-proof too and you will be amazed by the results. I can tell you because I've tried this and it always works.

(The video is in Spanish, but I will provide you with a step-by-step translation below. Go to the 17:17 mark and use it as a visual reference.)

• First, ask your butcher for a 3.3-pound (1.5 kilogram) well-marbled bone-in ribeye in vacuum packaging. The bone is important, because it helps to keeps the meat moist. The vacuum part is important too, because it will avoid oxidation.

• Put the meat out of the fridge at room temperature (not in a hot room, just normal temperature) for 24 hours inside the vacuum packaging. Don't take it out! It's important you do this step to have the perfect result.

• On a large, hot non-stick pan, add a spoon of olive oil and put the steak in 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Don't move or lift the steak after you place it. Just let it be and flip it when it's time.

• Take it out the pan and put it on a metal rack to rest for 10 minutes.

• Let the pan heat up again to the max and put the steak back in 4 to 5 minutes on one side (depending on the thickness).

• Flip the steak and add 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of butter. Continuously pour the resulting melted butter mixed with the meat juices over the top for another 4 to 5 minutes.

• Put it on a metal rack to rest for 5 minutes, covering it with some aluminum foil with three holes on it (so the vapor doesn't condensate.)

• Cut in filets and sprinkle some good quality sea salt like fleur de sel or Maldon.
