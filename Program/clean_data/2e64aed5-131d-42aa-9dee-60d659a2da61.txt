I'm a newbie at baking bread and I have made this recipe a few times and we loved it. Not quite what I was expecting (very dense) but good. The last time I made it I added an egg and it was amazing! I've added quite a few ingredients on occasion like garlic, cheese, pineapple juice, or even cinnamon and it always turns out great. This is my go-to basic bread recipe.
